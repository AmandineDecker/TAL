'''Beate Schmidt''' (born '''Wolfgang Schmidt''' October 5, 1966) is a [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]]. From October 1989 to April 1991, Schmidt murdered five women and an infant. Schmidt is a [[trans woman]].

==Early life==
Schmidt was born Wolfgang Schmidt on October 5, 1966 in [[Lehnin]], [[Brandenburg]], Germany.

==Serial killer==
Schmidt murdered five women and a three month old baby:
* Edeltraut Nixdorf, 51, killed on October 24, 1989.&lt;ref name="SPI"/&gt;
* Christa Naujoks, 45, raped and strangled to death on May 24, 1990.&lt;ref name="SPI"/&gt;
* Inge Fischer, 34, raped and stabbed to death on March 13, 1991 in [[Beelitz]].&lt;ref name="SPI"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13680463.html | title=Ein Ausholen zum Gegenschlag|trans-title=A knock-out to the counter-strike | author=Friedrichsen, Gisela | journal=Der Spiegel |date=November 1992  | issue=45|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tamara Petrowskaja, 44, strangled to death on March 22, 1991. Schmidt struck her son against a tree stump.&lt;ref name="SPI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article118105840/Der-Serienkiller-darf-sich-ein-bisschen-frei-bewegen.html|trans-title=The serial killer may move a bit freely |title=Der Serienkiller darf sich ein bisschen frei bewegen |newspaper=Die Welt |date=July 16, 2013 |accessdate=30 March 2014 |author=Becker, Claudia |language=de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202736/http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article118105840/Der-Serienkiller-darf-sich-ein-bisschen-frei-bewegen.html |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Talita Bremer, 66, strangled to death in April 5, 1991 and corpse was raped.&lt;ref name="SPI"/&gt;

The nickname the "Pink Giant" came from both the killer's size and alleged penchant for pink [[lingerie]].&lt;ref name="TPS"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Lupton|title=The Phantom Sanatorium: Beelitz Heilstatten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OYjluQAACAAJ|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Solar Books|isbn=978-0-9832480-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area where some of the crimes took place led to a second and third moniker, the "Beast of [[Beelitz]]" and "[[Beelitz]]-Murderer".&lt;ref name="TPS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EX"/&gt;

On August 1, 1991 Schmidt was arrested: two men had found Schmidt masturbating while wearing a bra under a jacket. Schmidt was sentenced to 15 years in prison and detention in a psychiatric hospital&lt;ref name="EX"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.exberliner.com/visiting/the-haunted-sanatorium-of-beelitz/ | title=The haunted sanatorium of Beelitz | publisher=Exberliner | date=May 5, 2011 | accessdate=30 March 2014 | author=Chalk, Titus | author2=Henze, Jacob | author3=Malmgren, Sigrid | last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brandenburg an der Havel]].&lt;ref name=beate&gt;Claus-Dieter Steyer: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/brandenburg/verurteilter-serienmoerder-durfte-namen-aendern/1573758.html ''Beate S. statt „Rosa Riese“: Verurteilter Serienmörder durfte Namen ändern''].

'''Peter Stumpp''' (died 1589) (whose name is also spelled as '''Peter Stube''', '''Peter Stubbe''', '''Peter Stübbe''' or '''Peter Stumpf''') was a German farmer, accused of [[werewolf]]ery, [[witchcraft]] and [[cannibalism]]. He was known as 'the Werewolf of Bedburg'.

== Sources ==
The most comprehensive source on the case is a pamphlet of 16 pages published in [[London]] in 1590, the translation of a German print of which no copies have survived. The English pamphlet, of which two copies exist (one in the British Museum and one in the Lambeth Library), was rediscovered by occultist [[Montague Summers]] in 1920. It describes Stumpp's life, alleged crimes and the trial, and includes many statements from neighbours and witnesses of the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', p. 91, {{ISBN|0-465-04125-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summers reprints the entire pamphlet, including a woodcut, on pages 253 to 259 of his work ''The Werewolf''.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Additional information is provided by the diaries of Hermann von Weinsberg, a Cologne alderman, and by a number of illustrated broadsheets, which were printed in southern Germany and were probably based on the German version of the London pamphlet.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The original documents seem to have been lost during the wars of the centuries that followed.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Contemporary reference was made to the pamphlet by [[Edward Fairfax]] in his firsthand account of the alleged witch persecution of his own daughters in 1621.&lt;ref name="autogenerated97"&gt;Edward Fairfax, Daemonologica: A Discourse on Witchcraft, p.97, R. Ackrill: Harrogate, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Peter Stumpp's name is also spelled as ''Peter Stube'', ''Peter Stub'',&lt;ref name="autogenerated97" /&gt; ''Peter Stubbe'', ''Peter Stübbe'' or ''Peter Stumpf'', and other aliases include such names as Abal Griswold, Abil Griswold, and Ubel Griswold. The name "Stump" or "Stumpf" may have been given him as a reference to the fact that his left hand had been cut off leaving only a stump, in German "Stumpf". {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
It was alleged that as the "werewolf" had its left forepaw cut off, then the same injury proved the guilt of the man. Stumpp was born at the village of Epprath near the country-town of [[Bedburg]] in the [[Electorate of Cologne]]. His actual date of birth is not known, as the local church registers were destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). He was a wealthy farmer of his rural community.&lt;ref name="autogenerated165"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers {{ISBN|1-85648-328-2}} p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1580s, he seems to have been a widower with two children; a girl called Beele (Sybil), who seems to have been older than fifteen years old, and a son of an unknown age.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

== Accusations ==
During 1589, Stumpp had one of the most lurid and famous [[werewolf]] trials of history. After being stretched on a [[Rack (torture)|rack]], and before further torture commenced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Friedrich |first=Otto |title=Going crazy: An inquiry into madness in our time |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1976 |isbn=0-671-22174-4 |edition=2nd prt. |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; he confessed to having practiced [[black magic]] since he was twelve years old. He claimed that the [[Devil]] had given him a magical [[Belt (clothing)|belt or girdle]], which enabled him to [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into "the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body, and mighty paws." Removing the belt, he said, made him transform back to his human form. No such belt was ever found after his arrest.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

For twenty-five years, Stumpp had allegedly been an "insatiable bloodsucker" who gorged on the flesh of [[goat]]s, lambs, and [[sheep]], as well as men, women, and children. Being threatened with torture he confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, two pregnant women, whose [[fetus]]es he ripped from their wombs and "ate their hearts panting hot and raw,"&lt;ref name="autogenerated165" /&gt; which he later described as "dainty morsels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/od/werewolves/a/The-Werewolf-Of-Bedburg.htm |title=The Werewolf of Bedburg |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061333/http://paranormal.about.com/od/werewolves/a/The-Werewolf-Of-Bedburg.htm |archive-date=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fourteen children was his own son, whose brain he was reported to have devoured.

Not only was Stumpp accused of being a serial murderer and [[Cannibalism|cannibal]], but also of having an [[incest]]uous relationship with his daughter,&lt;ref name="autogenerated165" /&gt; who was sentenced to die with him, and that he had coupled with a distant relative, which was also considered to be incestuous according to the law. In addition to this he confessed to having had intercourse with a [[succubus]] sent to him by the Devil.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

== Execution ==
[[File:Lukas Mayer 1589 Hinrichtung Peter Stump.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Composite [[woodcut]] print by Lukas Mayer of the execution of Peter Stumpp in 1589 at [[Bedburg]] near Cologne.]]
The execution of Stumpp, on October 31, 1589, and of his daughter and mistress, is one of the most brutal on record: he was put to a [[breaking wheel|wheel]], where "flesh was torn from his body", in ten places, with red-hot pincers, followed by his arms and legs. Then his limbs were broken with the blunt side of an axehead to prevent him from returning from the grave, before he was [[decapitation|beheaded]] and his body burned on a pyre.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} His daughter and mistress had already been flayed, strangled and were burned along with Stumpp's body. As a warning against similar behavior, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel and the figure of a wolf on it, and at the very top they placed Peter Stumpp's severed head.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

== Background ==
{{or section|date=April 2020}}
There are a number of details of the text of the London pamphlet that are inconsistent with the historical facts.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The years during which Stumpp was supposed to have committed most of his crimes (1582–1589) were marked by internal warfare in the [[Electorate of Cologne]] after the abortive introduction of Protestantism by the former Archbishop [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]]. He had been assisted by Adolf, Count of [[Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler|Neuenahr]], who was also the lord of [[Bedburg]].

Stumpp was most certainly a convert to Protestantism. The war brought the invasion of armies of either side, the assaults by marauding soldiers and eventually an epidemic of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

When the Protestants were defeated during 1587, Bedburg Castle became the headquarters of Catholic mercenaries commanded by the new lord of Bedburg—Werner, Count of [[Salm-Reifferscheid-Dyck|Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck]], who was a staunch Catholic determined to re-establish the Roman faith.

So it is not inconceivable that the werewolf trial was but a barely concealed political trial, with the help of which the new lord of Bedburg planned to bully the Protestants of the territory back into Catholicism. If it had been just another execution of an alleged werewolf and a couple of witches, as occurred about this time in various parts of Germany, the attendance of members of the aristocracy—perhaps including the new Archbishop and Elector of Cologne—would be surprising. Furthermore, the trial remained a singular event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunday Herald]], 1 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not mean that the charges were without basis in fact. The execution of a mere Protestant convert would have been deeply unlikely to have drawn the aristocratic attention Stumpp's trial did, and while it was unlikely for the elite to attend to any given werewolf or witch trial, the sheer scale of Stumpp's alleged crimes would have made it more visible to the public at large and the nobility.

==In popular culture==
English black metal band The Infernal Sea recorded a song called ''Skinwalker'' about the werewolf of Bedburg on their 2017 e.p Agents of Satan.
The U.S. metal band [[Macabre (band)|Macabre]] recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled "The Werewolf of Bedburg"; it can be found on the ''[[Murder Metal]]'' album.

The German horror punk band [[The Other (band)|The Other]] recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled "Werewolf of Bedburg"; it can be found on the ''[[Casket Case]]'' album.

In the [[Pine Deep Trilogy]] of novelist and folklorist [[Jonathan Maberry]], Peter Stumpp is the supernatural villain Ubel Griswold. Since Griswold is actually one of Stumpp's historical aliases, Maberry decided to use the name of Ubel Griswold instead of openly telling people that the villain was the infamous werewolf Peter Stumpp until later on in the third book of the series, ''Bad Moon Rising''.

In the [[Jim Butcher]] book ''[[Fool Moon (The Dresden Files)|Fool Moon]]'' there are several characters that use enchanted wolf pelt belts to transform into a wolf form, similar to the belt Peter Stumpp claimed to have.

A reference to Peter Stumpp is also made in [[William Peter Blatty]]'s book, ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]''. When Father Karras and Kinderman talk about Satanism they say "Terrible, was this theory, Father, or fact?" "Well, there's William Stumpf, for example. Or Peter. I can't remember. Anyway, a German in the sixteenth century who thought he was a werewolf".

The direct-to-video ''[[Big Top Scooby-Doo!]]'', uses a portion of Lukas Mayer's woodcut of the execution of Stumpp in 1589, though in the movie no mention of Stumpp is made. The portion used depicts a man cutting off a werewolf's left paw (supposedly Stumpp in werewolf form) and a child being attacked by a werewolf. The woodcut scene shown in the film restores the werewolf's left paw and removes the child in the second werewolf's jaws, making it appear as if the swordsman is fighting one of the werewolves while another flees.

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio drama ''[[Loups-Garoux]]'', Pieter Stubbe was in fact a werewolf. He managed to escape before he was executed and lived for another five centuries. He was defeated by the [[Fifth Doctor]] in Brazil in 2080. It is implied that he ate both the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] and [[John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]].

Journalist and fiction writer [[J.E. Reich]] partially based her short story "The Werewolves of Anspach," on the life of Peter Stumpp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://littlefiction.com/beta/JEReich_TheWerewolvesofAnspach.html |title=JEReich_TheWerewolvesofAnspach |website=littlefiction.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003525/http://littlefiction.com/beta/JEReich_TheWerewolvesofAnspach.html |archive-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Peter Stumpp was also told in episode 3 of the podcast ''[[Lore (podcast)|Lore]]'', released on April 6, 2015. In 2017, the podcast episode was adapted into the fifth episode of the [[Lore (TV series)|TV series adaptation]] of ''Lore'', where he was played by [[Adam Goldberg]].

The case inspired Neil MacKay's novel, 'The Wolf Trial' (Glasgow: Freight Books, 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-910449-72-1}})

Peter Stumpp is referenced in 'The Werewolf of Bamburg' by Oliver Potzsch. It briefly mentions his execution and crimes.

Peter Stumpp is referenced as a werewolf in "The Secret Life of Cooper Bennett" by Golden Czermak ({{ISBN|978-1976241550}})

'''David Thabo Simelane''' (born 1956) is a [[Swaziland|Swazi]] [[serial killer]] sentenced to death for the murder of 28 women, but is suspected of murdering 45.

== Life ==

=== Murders ===
Simelane left school, although his uncle tried to enable him to attend secondary school.

He testified in court that he had been sentenced to six years' imprisonment for robbing and raping a woman. Then, after his release in 1998, he set out to seek revenge by starting a murder series. The killings lasted from the late 1990s until 2001, when the police arrested him on public grounds.

Simelane made women go with him in the forest. He then tied his victims there and sexually assaulted them, stabbing or strangling them with his bare hands if they resisted too much. He also beheaded many of them, before or after death. Simelane often stole his victims' money and valuables to participate in gambling. Among his victims were several pregnant women.

=== Investigation ===
Shepherds in search of a runaway cow discovered body parts in the Usuthu-Pulp Forest in [[Malkerns]] and notified the authorities, who soon asked six [[South Africa]]n forensics experts for administrative assistance.

Simelane was arrested in April 2001 on a street near the graves and led the police to more graves, from which 45 bodies were found. Even the bodies of four babies were among the dead. Because of the highly advanced decay, Simelane was charged with 34 murders.

=== Trial and conviction ===
During the trial he was found guilty of murder in 28 cases and [[sentenced to death]] by hanging. He showed no remorse for his actions during his trial.

After an appeal to the Swazi Supreme Court in November 2011, it was decided that the trial took an inadmissibly long time, but the death sentence that awaited Simelane has been confirmed.

== Personal life ==
According to his aunt, Simelane found faith in prison and sees himself as a "born-again Christian", preaching to fellow inmates.&lt;ref name="Swaziland News"&gt;[http://www.swazilive.com/Swaziland_News/Swaziland_News_Stories.asp?News_id=2722 Swaziland News David SIMELANE gets death penalty, to be hanged]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was born on August 30, 1952. He grew up in [[South Central Los Angeles]], California.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He married and had two children.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He was given a [[general discharge]] from the [[United States Army]] on July 24, 1975, after having been released from prison for his conviction of gang-raping a 17-year-old girl in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/crime/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-lonnie-franklin-once-gang-raped-a-german-teen/|title='Grim Sleeper' Serial Killer Lonnie Franklin Once Gang Raped a German Teen|website=PEOPLE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin and two other servicemen stationed in Stuttgart stopped to ask directions from the teen then offered her a ride home. When she accepted, they put a knife to her throat, drove her to a field and repeatedly raped her. She was able to feign interest in Franklin and asked for his phone number, by which police identified him.&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt;

During the [[gang rape]] photographs were taken by one of the rapists – as was the case with the women Lonnie Franklin raped and murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abc7.com/1356478/|title=Grim Sleeper jury to hear testimony from earliest known victim|date=May 26, 2016|website=ABC7 Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he was also convicted of two charges of theft, one charge of misdemeanor assault, and one charge of [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. He served time for one of the theft charges.&lt;ref name=abcnews1&gt;{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/familys-dna-led-police-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=11116381&amp;page=2|title=New Technique of Using Family's DNA Led Police to 'Grim Sleeper' Suspect|publisher=ABC News|date=2010-07-08|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In the 1980s, the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] marked the deaths of several women in [[South Los Angeles, California|South Los Angeles]] with the identification “NHI”, meaning "no humans involved",{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which was used for cases involving chronic [[drug user]]s and [[prostitution in the United States|prostitutes]]. Margaret Prescod formed the "Black Women Count" movement with community members to pressure the LAPD into acknowledging the deaths as serial killings and forming a task force in response. The coalition launched a media campaign and set a monetary reward aiming to capture the killer. The joint LAPD-[[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] investigation determined that the crimes were committed by a single person labeled the "Southside Slayer". Their results were announced to the public on September 23, 1985.&lt;ref name=SSS/&gt;

According to investigators, evidence was found suggesting that several serial killers were murdering women in South Los Angeles. [[Louis Craine]] committed at least two of the "Southside Slayer" murders, and [[Michael Hughes (serial killer)|Michael Hughes]], [[Daniel Lee Siebert]], [[Chester Turner]], and [[Ivan Hill]] committed at least one each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Map: Serial Killers in South L.A. |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 3 August 2010 |url= https://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-serialkillersmap-0804-i,0,515310.htmlstory |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate series of killings commenced with the murder of Debra Jackson and a different ''[[modus operandi]]'' involving a firearm.&lt;ref name=SSS&gt;{{cite web |last= Jones |first= Jack |title= Man Sought in Slayings of 10 L.A.-Area Prostitutes |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 24 September 1985 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-24/news/mn-18536_1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These became known, misleadingly, as the "Strawberry Murders." Sheriff's Detective Rickey Ross was wrongfully arrested due to a ballistics error. Two decades later, the perpetrator of these crimes was dubbed the "Grim Sleeper" due to the long period of apparent inactivity between murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jill Stewart |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-07-15/news/missing-the-grim-sleeper-by-a-hair/1 |title=Missing the Grim Sleeper by a Hair|work=LA Weekly |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, the slaying of Janecia Peters, 25, was linked through [[DNA]] analysis to at least eleven unsolved murders in Los Angeles, the first of which occurred in 1985. That same year, in secrecy, the LAPD formed the "800 Task Force," composed of six detectives and overseen by the Robbery-Homicide Unit. After a four-month investigation, ''[[LA Weekly]]'' [[investigative journalism|investigative reporter]] Christine Pelisek broke the news of the task force's existence, the link between Peters' killing and the earlier murders, and the silence of [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Mayor]] [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] and Police Chief [[William J. Bratton]] regarding the killer's existence. Villaraigosa and Bratton neither issued a press release nor warned the community. In some cases, ''LA Weekly'' was the first to inform the families that their daughters had long been confirmed as victims of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=LAWeekly0/&gt;

In early September 2008, Los Angeles officials announced that they were offering a $500,000 reward to help catch the killer.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt; On November 1, the case was featured on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=60381/ |title=Most Wanted fugitives website (defunct) |date= |work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022040939/http://www.amw.com/ |archivedate=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 2009, Bratton addressed the press for the first time regarding the case, at which time the police formally gave the killer the "Grim Sleeper" nickname chosen by ''LA Weekly''. Bratton also released a [[9-1-1]] call from the 1980s in which a man reported seeing a body being dumped by Franklin, giving a detailed description and license plate number of a van connected with the now-closed Cosmopolitan Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pelisek |first=Christine |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |title=Tape May Hold Clue to Identifying Grim Sleeper Serial Killer – Los Angeles News – The Informer |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803080447/http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/1tape-may-hold-clue-to-identif/ |archive-date=2009-08-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Pelisek conducted an extensive interview with Enietra Washington, the sole survivor of Franklin's attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-08-28/news/grim-sleeper/4 |title=Grim Sleeper Returns: He's Murdering Angelenos, as Cops Hunt his DNA|work=LA Weekly |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAWeekly1&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/2 |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington described him as "a black man in his early 30s [⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠] He looked neat. Tidy. Kind of geeky. He wore a black polo shirt tucked into khaki trousers." She also described the interior and exterior of his vehicle.&lt;ref name=survive&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Pelisek |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-03-12/news/grim-sleeper-39-s-sole-survivor/ |title=Grim Sleeper's Sole Survivor|work=LA Weekly |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 7, 2010, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an arrest had been made. Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley identified the suspect as 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr., a mechanic who worked between 1981 and 1988 for the City of Los Angeles in the sanitation department and briefly for the LAPD.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt; Franklin was identified for arrest, at least in part, on [[DNA profiling#DNA evidence as evidence in criminal trials|familial DNA analysis]].&lt;ref name=latimesblog&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/lapd-make-arrest-in-grim-sleeper-serial-killings.html |title=LAPD make arrest in Grim Sleeper serial killings |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= 2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police had found no exact match between DNA found at the crime scenes and any of the profiles in California's DNA profile database, so they searched the database for stored profiles that demonstrated sufficient similarity to allow police to infer a familial relationship. They found similar DNA belonging to Franklin's son, Christopher, who had been convicted of a [[felony]] weapons charge. According to Cooley, detectives then used a piece of discarded pizza with Franklin's DNA to make the link.&lt;ref name=yahoonews1/&gt;

One undercover police officer pretended to be a waiter at a restaurant where Franklin ate, collecting dishes, silverware, glasses, and pizza crusts to obtain DNA.&lt;ref name=yahoonews1/&gt; The identification was used to arrest Franklin after his DNA was obtained and deemed a match.&lt;ref name=CNN1/&gt; Saliva found on the victims established a DNA match linking Franklin to the deaths.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt;

Law enforcement missed an opportunity to catch Franklin because his DNA was not previously collected. In 2003, Franklin was convicted of a felony and was serving three years of supervised [[probation]]. In 2004, voters passed [[California Proposition 69 (2004)|Proposition 69]], which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the system but was not as probation officers did not collect samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. The probation department did not have the resources to collect samples until August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-dna-20100715|title=Authorities Missed A Chance to Catch Grim Sleeper Suspect|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-07-15|accessdate=2010-07-23|first=Jack|last=Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2010, the LAPD released 180 photos of women, found in Franklin's home after unsuccessful attempts to identify the individuals, possibly additional victims. "These people are not suspects, we don't even know if they are victims, but we do know this: Lonnie Franklin's reign of terror in the city of Los Angeles, which spanned well over two decades, culminating with almost a dozen murder victims, certainly needs to be investigated further," said Police Chief [[Charlie Beck]].&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt;

In all, investigators found over 1,000 photos and several hundred hours of video in his home.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitcomb |first=Dan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BF6EU20101216 |title=L.A. police release photos of possible Grim Sleeper victims |publisher=Reuters |date= 2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show mainly black women of a wide age range, from teenagers to middle-aged and older, often nude. Police believe Franklin took many of the pictures, which show both conscious and unconscious individuals, dating back 30 years.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt; The photos were released to the public in an effort to identify the women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayes |first=Kevin |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20026038-504083.html |title="Grim Sleeper" Photos: LAPD Deluged with Calls - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/grim-sleeper-serial-killer-victim-photos-released-los/story?id=12424559 |title=Five Women Tentatively Identified in 'Grim Sleeper' Cas - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2010-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2011, [[Reuters]] reported that the police were considering Franklin as a suspect in six more slayings of additional female victims. The police were investigating two of the six as potential victims killed during a 14-year lapse between an initial spate of Grim Sleeper murders that ended in 1988 and several more that began in 2002. Of the remaining four victims, two bodies were discovered in the 1980s and two were reported missing in 2005 but the remains of the other two were never found, police said. Detectives said they linked Franklin to the six additional killings after reviewing hundreds of old case files and seeking the public's help in identifying a collection of 180 photographs of women and girls that were found in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Kandel |first= Jason |title= Police tie "Grim Sleeper" suspect to six more killings |publisher= Reuters |date= 3 November 2011 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/03/us-crime-grimsleeper-idUSTRE7A20L120111103 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rubin |first= Joel |title= Police link 6 more slayings to Grim Sleeper suspect |work= Los Angeles Times |publisher= |date= 29 October 2011 |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/29/local/la-me-grim-sleeper-20111029 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Olivia |first= Katrandjian |author2=Lauren Effron |author3=Lauren Sher |author4=Neal Karlinsky |title= Six More Deaths Linked to Grim Sleeper Serial Killer |work= abc NIGHTLINE |publisher= abc NEWS |date= 29 October 2011 |url= https://abcnews.go.com/US/deaths-linked-grim-sleeper-serial-killer/story?id=14842183#.TwMkn_KDtXU |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
The known killings began in 1985 in South Los Angeles. The "Grim Sleeper" apparently took a 14-year hiatus after his last known crime in 1988 and the murders then resumed in 2002 (leading to the epithet by which he is known), but this history may be only an accident of the evidence collected. The last confirmed slaying was in January 2007.&lt;ref name=abcnews1/&gt; All of his victims were found outdoors, often in alleys a short distance from downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/07/arrest-la-grim-sleeper-killings/|title=Arrest Made in L.A. 'Grim Sleeper' Killings|publisher=FOX News|date=2010-07-07|accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Efren Saldivar''' (born September 30, 1969) is an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who murdered patients while working as a [[respiratory therapist]] in the state of [[California]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Brownsville, Texas]], he graduated from the College of Medical and Dental Careers in [[North Hollywood, California]] in 1988. He obtained work as a respiratory therapist employed by the [[Adventist Health Glendale|Glendale Adventist Medical Center]], working the [[shift work|night shift]] when there were fewer staff on duty.

==Murders==
He killed his patients by injecting a [[paralytic]] drug which led to respiratory and/or [[cardiac arrest]]. These drugs could have included [[morphine]] and [[suxamethonium chloride]] as they were found in his locker with fresh and used syringes.&lt;ref name=ramsland&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/efren_saldivar/1.html All about Efren Saldivar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429114631/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/efren_saldivar/1.html |date=2006-04-29 }}, by Katherine Ramsland, at Crimelibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pancuronium]] (brand name Pavulon) definitely was used in six murders;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/S/SALDIVAR_efren.php |title=Serial killer true crime library - Effren Saldivar |access-date=2006-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521161131/http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/S/SALDIVAR_efren.php |archive-date=2008-05-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; this drug is used to stop a patient's [[respiratory system|respiration]] when they are about to be put on a [[medical ventilator]]. He was careful in the selection of his victims, choosing those who were unconscious and close to death. This led to no easily detectable rise in the rate or distribution of patient deaths when he was on duty. This in turn hampered the investigation, as there were no easily discernible correlations between changes in the distribution or rate of deaths and his shift pattern (a commonly used tool in examining whether [[malpractice]] is taking place).

His medical employment was ended on March 13, 1998. Shortly afterward, he confessed to 50 murders (a confession he later retracted). In searching for evidence that would be strong enough to obtain a court conviction, the police exhumed the remains of patients who had died while Saldivar had been on duty and been buried (rather than [[cremation|cremated]]).  The marker that was being sought was unusually high levels of Pavulon in the cadaver, as this drug remains identifiable for many months (unlike succinylcholine chloride and [[morphine]] which are decomposed into innocuous compounds relatively rapidly).

After 20 exhumations, six cadavers had evidence of a lethal concentration of Pavulon. On March 12, 2002 Saldivar [[guilty plea|pleaded guilty]] to those six counts of murder and received six consecutive [[life sentence]]s without the possibility of [[parole]]. He is incarcerated in [[California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Corcoran]].

==Number of victims==
The former head of the respiratory care department at [[Loma Linda University]], Tom Malinowski, led the internal investigation by [[Adventist Health System|Adventist Health]]. Statistical analysis indicates that the total number of murders committed by Saldivar could be as high as 200, but no convincing physical evidence will ever be available to confirm or refute this possibility due to bodies being cremated after death or simply the effects of bodily harm.

'''Gerard John Schaefer Jr.''' (March 25, 1946{{spnd}}December 3, 1995) was an American murderer and suspected [[serial killer]] who was imprisoned in 1973 for murders he committed while he was a sheriff's deputy in [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]], [[Florida]]. Schaefer was convicted of two murders, but was suspected of many others. He frequently appealed against his conviction, but privately boasted, both verbally and in writing, of killing more than thirty women and girls. In December 1995, Schaefer was stabbed to death in his prison cell.

== Early life ==
Gerard Schaefer was the first of three children born to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents, Gerard and Doris Marie (née Runcie) Schaefer. He was born in [[Wisconsin]] and was raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he attended [[Marist School (Georgia)|Marist Academy]] until 1960 when his family moved to [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. Schaefer did not get along well with his father, who he believed favored his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  first1=Catherine|last1=Cole|first2=Cynthia|last2=Young|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7K4amzFbIrYC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=St.+Thomas+Aquinas+High+School+Gerard+Schaefer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYZXzXo-11&amp;sig=IrrVelIDattEMG4MVndcjeeU5nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi11_j5yuPbAhWTAHwKHaoSBKI4ChDoAQhDMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20High%20School%20Gerard%20Schaefer&amp;f=false |title=True Crime: Florida: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania|date=2011|page=50|chapter=The Cop Killer|isbn=978-0811744393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teens, he began an obsession with women's [[underwear]] and became a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]], spying on a neighbor girl named Leigh Hainline, of whose subsequent murder he is suspected. Schaefer would later admit to [[zoosadism|killing animals]] in his youth and [[cross dressing]], although at other times he claimed the latter was solely part of his successful attempt to avoid the [[Conscription|draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  first1=Catherine|last1=Cole|first2=Cynthia|last2=Young|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7K4amzFbIrYC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=St.+Thomas+Aquinas+High+School+Gerard+Schaefer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYZXzXo-11&amp;sig=IrrVelIDattEMG4MVndcjeeU5nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi11_j5yuPbAhWTAHwKHaoSBKI4ChDoAQhDMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20High%20School%20Gerard%20Schaefer&amp;f=false |title=True Crime: Florida: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania|date=2011|page=50|chapter=The Cop Killer|isbn=978-0811744393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  first1=Catherine|last1=Cole|first2=Cynthia|last2=Young|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7K4amzFbIrYC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=St.+Thomas+Aquinas+High+School+Gerard+Schaefer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYZXzXo-11&amp;sig=IrrVelIDattEMG4MVndcjeeU5nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi11_j5yuPbAhWTAHwKHaoSBKI4ChDoAQhDMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20High%20School%20Gerard%20Schaefer&amp;f=false |title=True Crime: Florida: The State's Most Notorious Criminal Cases |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania|date=2011|page=50|chapter=The Cop Killer|isbn=978-0811744393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaefer went to college at [[Florida Atlantic University]], and got married during that time. In 1969, he became a teacher at [[Plantation High School]], but was soon fired for "totally inappropriate behavior", according to the principal.&lt;ref name="Parker2014"&gt;{{cite book |first=RJ |last=Parker |editor-first=Deb |editor-last=Hartwell|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmfxBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |title=Serial Killer Groupies |date=2014 |pages=136–37 |chapter=Protect and Serve: Gerard John Schaefer |doi= |hdl= |isbn=978-1-5025-4090-4 |issn= |eissn= |lccn= |oclc= |ol=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being turned down from the [[priesthood]], Schaefer turned to law enforcement as a career, graduating as a patrolman at the end of 1971 at age 25.

== Arrest ==
On July 21, 1972, Schaefer picked up two teenage girls who were [[hitchhiking]] while on patrol. He abducted them, took them to a remote forest and tied them to trees where he threatened to kill them or sell them into [[prostitution]]. However, Schaefer was called away on his police radio, leaving the girls tied up. He vowed that he would return.

The two girls, who were aged 17 and 18, escaped their bonds and went to the nearest police station, which was actually their kidnapper's own station. When Schaefer returned to the woods and found his victims gone, he called his station and claimed that he had done "something foolish", explaining that he had pretended to kidnap and threaten to kill two hitchhikers in order to scare them into avoiding such an irresponsible method of travel. Schaefer's boss did not believe him and he ordered Schaefer to the station, where he was stripped of his badge and charged with [[false imprisonment]] and [[assault]].

After posting [[bail]], Schaefer was released. Two months later, on September 27, 1972, Schaefer abducted, [[torture]]d, and murdered Susan Place, aged 17, and Georgia Jessup, 16, and buried them in Oak Hammock Park in [[Port Saint Lucie, Florida]]. In December 1972, Schaefer appeared in court in relation to the July abductions. Due to a [[plea bargain]], he was able to plead guilty to just one charge of [[aggravated assault]], for which he received a sentence of one year.

== Murder conviction ==
In April 1973, over six months after they vanished, the [[decomposition|decomposing]], mutilated remains of Place and Jessup were found. The girls had been tied to a tree at some point and had vanished while hitchhiking. These similarities to Schaefer's treatment of the girls who had escaped led the police to obtain a search warrant for the house he and his wife shared with Schaefer's mother.

In Schaefer's bedroom, the police found lurid stories he had written that were full of descriptions of the torture, [[rape]], and murder of women, whom he routinely referred to as "whores" and "sluts". More damningly, the authorities found personal possessions such as [[jewelry]], [[Diary|diaries]], and in one case, [[teeth]] from at least eight young women and girls who had gone missing in recent years. Some of the jewelry was from Leigh Hainline Bonadies, Schaefer's neighbor from when they were teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19780512&amp;id=T1RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,3669114&amp;hl=en |title=Lakeland Ledger |access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonadies had vanished in 1969 in Fort Lauderdale, after leaving a note for her husband saying she was making a short trip to [[Miami]]. Schaefer was never charged in connection with her case. Her skull, which was found to have multiple bullet holes, was discovered at a construction site in [[Palm Beach County]] in April 1978 and identified one month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19780512&amp;id=T1RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qfoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6167,3669114&amp;hl=en |title=Lakeland Ledger |access-date=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also among the items was a purse identified as belonging to Place. Place's mother later identified Schaefer as being the man she last saw with her daughter and Jessup. Schaefer was charged with the murders of Place and Jessup. In October 1973, he was found guilty and given two [[life sentence]]s. Authorities soon stated that he was linked to around 30 missing women and girls.

Place and Jessup may not have been Schaefer's final victims; two 14-year-old girls named Mary Briscolina and Elsie Farmer vanished while hitchhiking on October 23, 1972, just a few weeks after Place and Jessup were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ruth.buddell/schaefer.htm |title=Gerard Schaefer |website=Murderers Database (United Kingdom) |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710153845/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ruth.buddell/schaefer.htm |archivedate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies were later recovered, and jewelry belonging to one of the girls was later found in Schaefer's home.

== Imprisonment and death ==
Schaefer [[appeal]]ed his conviction, claiming at one point that he had been framed. All his appeals were rejected. Schaefer later began filing [[frivolous lawsuit]]s, trying to sue one [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] writer, Patrick Kendrick, for describing him as "an overweight, doughy, middle aged man who preyed on victims who were psychologically and physiologically weaker than him", and separately trying to sue authors [[Sondra London]], [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Michael Newton (author)|Michael Newton]] and former FBI agent [[Robert Ressler]] for describing Schaefer as a [[serial killer]].

In support of her defense against the lawsuit, London compiled an exhibit of photocopies of 500 incriminating pages of his handwritten correspondence, and the judge dismissed Schaefer's complaint without further ado. After London provided copies of the 500-page exhibit to Newton and Wilson, Schaefer's lawsuits against them were also dismissed. Kendrick's suit was continued until Schaefer's own murder in prison.

Until his death Schaefer continued to threaten Sondra London. He also wrote threatening letters to Kendrick, suggesting he had willing agents who would do his bidding and that Schaefer "would hate to see something happen to your family". Kendrick went on to write fiction novels often describing brutal murders, which he relates to his experience with Schaefer.

On December 3, 1995, Schaefer was found stabbed to death in his cell. Fellow inmate Vincent Rivera was convicted in 1999 of killing Schaefer and had 53 years and ten months added to the life-plus-twenty years sentence he was already serving for double murder. Rivera did not confess to the crime, nor give a motive, although he did reveal highly relevant circumstances in correspondence he sent to Sondra London; to wit, Rivera had been an ear-witness to the prison murder of Frank Valdes in the second assault by corrections staff he sustained. Rivera had written a complaint about the first assault on Valdez, and was still held in the cell next to Valdez when the second beating killed him. Rivera was actively resisting the cover-up claiming Valdez had killed himself, filing multiple grievances and appeals, when he was accused of killing Schaefer.

Schaefer's sister Sara told reporters that Schaefer's murder was a cover-up related to his attempts to verify the confession to the killing of [[Murder of Adam Walsh|Adam Walsh]] that [[Ottis Toole]] had made and then subsequently retracted. Sondra London declared it was more likely due to Schaefer informing on other inmates. In the year before his demise, Schaefer repeatedly had human wastes thrown at him, and had his cell set on fire twice.

Schaefer made multiple statements to London, to the effect that he used his status as a "death row law clerk" to get confidential information from prisoners which found their way to the prosecutor's office, only to be used at trial against the inmates. Schaefer's classification officer stated to Sondra London that this was why Schaefer was under siege, because Schaefer's last attempt to curry favor with authorities had targeted an inmate who was well respected behind bars.

Official sources put out the story that Vincent Rivera killed Schaefer in an argument over a cup of coffee, but after attending the murder trial and debriefing Rivera, Sondra London declared this story implausible, noting several little-known facts: a full-palm print in blood was found on the wall of Schaefer's cell, but when lab results failed to match it to either Schaefer or Rivera, the evidence was thrown out instead of being presented to the jury. Schaefer's body was found covered with boot prints, and expert testimony at Rivera's trial established that the patterns of the prints matched those of boots issued to corrections officers. It was further established that no prisoners were allowed to wear those particular boots.

At the time of Schaefer's death, Broward County homicide detective John King and homicide chief Tim Bronson were preparing to bring charges against Schaefer for three more unsolved murders to ensure he would never get out of prison.

== ''Killer Fiction'' ==
Sondra London, a true crime writer who had been Schaefer's girlfriend in high school, interviewed him at length following his conviction, and published a compilation of his short stories and drawings entitled ''Killer Fiction'' in 1990. A second book, ''Beyond Killer Fiction'', followed two years later. Schaefer's stories typically involved savage, graphic torture and murder of women, usually from the perspective of the killer, who was often a rogue police officer.&lt;ref name="Bourgoin2015"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gur-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95 |title=Sex Beast{{nnbsp}}: Sur la trace du pire tueur en série de tous les temps |date=2015 |page=95 |first=Stéphane |last=Bourgoin |language=fr |trans-title=Sex Beast: On the Trail of the Worst Serial Killer of All Time |publisher=Grasset |location=Paris |isbn=978-2-246-85511-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised edition of ''Killer Fiction'', released after Schaefer's death, included stories and rambling articles from the first two books and a collection of letters to London, in which Schaefer confessed to killing 34 women and girls, and bragged that he had impressed fellow inmate [[Ted Bundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard John Schaefer's Art.

London noted that at the time Schaefer was corresponding with her, he was publicly proclaiming his innocence and threatening to sue anyone who labeled him a serial killer. In one letter, Schaefer wrote that he began murdering women in 1965, when he was 19. In another, he boasted of killing and [[cannibal]]izing two schoolgirls, nine-year-old Peggy Rahn and eight-year-old Wendy Stevenson, who vanished in December 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id=2241DFFL |title=Peggy Rahn |work=The Doe Network |url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2241dffl.html |date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id=2242DFFL |title=Wendy Brown Stevenson |work=The Doe Network |url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2242dffl.html |date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly, Schaefer had denied any involvement.&lt;ref name=Schaefer2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaefer |first=G.J. |author-link=Gerard Schaefer |editor-last=London |editor-first=Sondra |editor-link=Sondra London |title=Killer Fiction |publisher=Feral House |location=Vancouver, Washington|date=2011 |isbn=978-1-936239-19-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82–90}}

London ended her collaboration with Schaefer in 1991, after repudiating his story that he was merely a "framed ex-cop" who wrote lurid fiction. When she stated that he was indeed every bit the serial killer he simultaneously boasted of being, Schaefer allegedly repeatedly threatened her life and filed suit against her for calling him a serial killer in print.&lt;ref name=Schaefer2011/&gt;{{rp|142}}

'''Tommy Lynn Sells''' (June 28, 1964 – April 3, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. He was convicted of one murder, for which he received the death penalty and was eventually executed. Authorities believe he committed a total of 22 murders.

==Early life==
Sells and his twin sister, Tammy Jean, contracted [[meningitis]] when they were 18 months old; Tammy died from the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Michael H.|title=The Anatomy of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVRfs_5TmpYC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=Tommy+Lynn+Sells+meningitis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vYjB6NAweE&amp;sig=--kYgrIppA7tRFRTva6icfkkSWI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMx8rdiKTUAhUS0mMKHUKrDLg4ChDoAQhNMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Tommy%20Lynn%20Sells%20meningitis&amp;f=false|publisher=Prometheus Books|accessdate=June 4, 2017|page=229 |language=en|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacCormack|first1=John|title=Killer Smile|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/killer-smile-6394042|accessdate=June 4, 2017|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date= September 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Sells was sent to live with his aunt, Bonnie Walpole, in [[Holcomb, Missouri]]. When he was five years old, he was returned to his mother after she found out his aunt wanted to adopt him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/serial-killer-tommy-lynn-sells-973154|title=Profile of Serial Killer Tommy Lynn Sells|publisher=ThoughtCo|date= February 22, 2018|accessdate= December 11, 2018|first=Charles|last=Montaldo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sells claimed that when he was eight, he began spending time with a man named Willis Clark, who began to [[child molestation|molest]] him with the consent of his mother. Sells stated that this abuse affected him greatly, and he would relive his experiences while committing his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugzyiC3z7Qo|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homeless Sells hitchhiked and train-hopped across the United States from 1978 to 1999, committing various crimes along the way. He held several very short-term manual-labor and barber jobs. He drank heavily, [[Addiction|abused drugs]], and was [[Imprisonment|imprisoned]] [[recidivism|several times]].&lt;ref name="CL5"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Krajicek|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/tommy_sells/5.html|title=A life of crime|website=[[TruTV|Crime Library]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062153/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/tommy_sells/5.html|archive-date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Michael H. Stone &amp; Gary Brucato. The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 180-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous crimes, sentences, and mental disorders==
In 1990, Sells stole a truck in [[Wyoming]] and was [[prison sentence|sentenced]] to 16 months' imprisonment. He was diagnosed with a [[personality disorder]] consisting of [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] features, [[substance use disorder]] (severe [[opioid]], [[cannabis]], [[amphetamine]]s, and [[alcoholism|alcohol dependence]]), [[bipolar disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name="CL6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TLS&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Aamodt|title=Sells, Tommy Lynn|url=http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/Psyc%20405/serial%20killers/Sells,%20Tommy%20Lynn%20-%202005.pdf|work=Department of Psychology|publisher=[[Radford University]]|location=Radford, Virginia|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1992, a 19-year-old woman in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], was driving when she saw Sells panhandling under an overpass with a sign that said, "I will work for food."&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; She felt sorry for him and took him to her home, asking him to wait outside. She went into her home to get some food for him, and by the time she got back to her front door, he was inside. When she walked away to get something else, he got a knife from her kitchen and trapped her in a bedroom, and [[rape]]d her repeatedly.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;

The woman fought back by hitting him in the head with a ceramic duck; in retaliation, Sells beat her with a piano stool. He also stabbed her 18 times.&lt;ref name="CL6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; He was indicted on five counts of rape and felony assault in September 1992, but took a plea deal and pleaded guilty to [[Grievous bodily harm|malicious wounding]]. On June 25, 1993, he was sentenced to [[Indefinite imprisonment|2–⁠10 years' imprisonment]]; the rape charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;

While serving this sentence, he was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] and married Nora Price. He was released in 1997 and moved to [[Tennessee]] with his wife. He left her and resumed his cross-country travels.&lt;ref name="CL6"&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Krajicek |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/tommy_sells/6.html|title=Murder Interrupted|website=[[TruTV|Crime Library]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403211417/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/tommy_sells/6.html|archive-date=April 3, 2014|access-date=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Sells is believed by police to have murdered at least 22 people. Retired [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] John Allen said, "We did confirm 22... I know there's more. I know there's a lot more. Obviously, we won't ever know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.ksat.com/news/supreme-court-to-decide-tommy-lynn-sells-execution-drug-case/25298296|title=Supreme Court to decide Tommy Lynn Sells execution drug case|website=K-SAT.com|location=San Antonio, Texas|date=April 3, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407114622/http://www.ksat.com/news/supreme-court-to-decide-tommy-lynn-sells-execution-drug-case/25298296|archivedate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sells said he committed his first murder at age 15, after breaking into a house. While in the house, Sells claimed to have discovered a man performing [[fellatio]] on a boy and killed the man in a fit of rage.&lt;ref name=TLS/&gt;

In July 1985, 21-year-old Sells worked at a [[Forsyth, Missouri]], carnival, where he met 28-year-old Ena Cordt (November 15, 1956 – July 27, 1985) and her 4-year-old son Rory (August 3, 1980 – July 27, 1985).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Newton|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|date=2006|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Ena+Cordt+28&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q7iNUp2VEImqyQGF44HwAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| edition=2| chapter=Sells, Tommy Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordt invited Sells to her home that evening. According to Sells, he had sex with her, fell asleep, and awoke to find her stealing from his backpack. He proceeded to beat Cordt to death with her son's baseball bat. He then murdered her son because the child was a potential witness. The bludgeoned bodies were found 3 days later, by which time Sells had left town.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

Sells is linked to these crimes:

After watching an episode of ''[[Crime Watch Daily]]'' in November 2015, Melissa DeBoer ''née'' Tate, whose mother JoAnne Tate was murdered in 1982 and whose testimony as a 7 year old helped identify Rodney Lincoln as the killer, contacted authorities stating that she is now certain it was Sells, not Lincoln, who murdered her mother in 1982.{{cn|date=April 2020}}

==Arrests and confessions==
[[File:PolunskyUnitWestLivingstonTX.jpg|thumb|Allan B. Polunsky Unit, where Sells was located]]
On December 31, 1999, in the Guajia Bay subdivision, west of [[Del Rio, Texas]], Sells sexually assaulted, stabbed, and slit the throat of 13-year-old Kaylene "Katy" Harris, and slit the throat of 10-year-old Krystal Surles.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; Surles survived and received help from the neighbors after traveling a quarter-mile to their home with a severed trachea.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; Sells was apprehended after being identified from a [[facial composite|sketch]] made from the victim's description. Police over time came to suspect him of "working the system" by confessing to murders he had not committed.&lt;ref name="mac"/&gt;

The [[state's attorney]] in [[Jefferson County, Illinois]], declined to charge Sells with the Dardeen family homicides in 1987 because his confession to the quadruple killing, while generally consistent with the facts of the case as reported in the media, was inaccurate with concern to some details that had not been made public. He also changed his account three times regarding how he had met the family.&lt;ref name="Dardeen case"&gt;{{cite news|last=Suhr|first=Jim|title=Unsolved 1987 slaying of Illinois family haunting|url=http://www.nwherald.com/2014/04/12/unsolved-1987-slaying-of-illinois-family-haunting/auj00b/|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|via=[[Northwest Herald]]|date=April 12, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators wanted to bring Sells to [[southern Illinois]] to resolve their doubts, but Texas refused, due to its law forbidding [[death-row]] prisoners from leaving the state.&lt;ref name="Texas not allowing him out of state"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gauen|first=Pat|title=Gruesome Illinois mystery appears to end with Texas execution|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/pat-gauen/gauen-gruesome-illinois-mystery-appears-to-end-with-texas-execution/article_b5a3da6c-c649-5725-8a7e-23f96873f514.html|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=April 10, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sells was housed on death row in the [[Allan B. Polunsky Unit]] near [[Livingston, Texas]]. The [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] received him on November 8, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_info/sellstommy.html Tommy Sells profile], [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Sells confessed that on October 13, 1997, he broke into a home, took a knife from a butcher block in the kitchen, stabbed a little boy to death, and scuffled with a woman. Those details corroborated the account of Julie Rea Harper, who was initially convicted for the murder of her son, and then acquitted in 2006.&lt;ref name="mich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Julie Rea, Center on Wrongful Convictions: Bluhm Legal Clinic, Northwestern University School of Law|url = http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/il/julie-rea.html|website = www.law.northwestern.edu|accessdate = December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The end|url = http://illinoistimes.com/article-3319-the-end.html|website = illinoistimes.com|accessdate = December 14, 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
On January 3, 2014, a Del Rio judge set Sells' execution date for April 3, 2014.&lt;ref name="executiondate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/Execution-Date-Set-For-Texas-Inmate-Linked-To-A-Dozen-Slayings-238607271.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104055758/http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/Execution-Date-Set-For-Texas-Inmate-Linked-To-A-Dozen-Slayings-238607271.html|url-status=dead|title="Execution Date Set For Texas Inmate Linked To A Dozen Slayings"|archivedate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newschannel10.com/story/25150023/serial-killer-executed-with-texas-new-drug-supply Execution date set for Tommy Sells], newschannel10.com; accessed April 5, 2014.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070451/http://www.newschannel10.com/story/25150023/serial-killer-executed-with-texas-new-drug-supply |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sells' death sentence was carried out at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary]] in [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]]. When asked if he would like to make a final statement, Sells replied, "No." As a lethal dose of [[pentobarbital]] was administered, he took a few deep breaths, closed his eyes, and began to snore. Less than a minute later, he stopped moving. Thirteen minutes later, at 6:27 pm ([[Central Time Zone#Central Daylight Time|CDT]]), he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref name="executed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news?ocid=ansnews11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406131024/http://news.msn.com/crime-justice/serial-killer-executed-with-texas-new-drug-supply?ocid=ansnews11|url-status=dead|title=Breaking News Stories from US and Around the World &amp;#124; MSN News|archivedate=April 6, 2014|website=www.msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krystal Surles and members of both the Harris and Perez families attended the execution.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;

== In media ==
Eight years before his execution, Sells was one of the featured interviewees on episode two ''("Cold-Blooded Killers")'' of season one on the [[Investigation Discovery]] documentary series, ''[[Most Evil]]''. The interview was done by [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Michael Stone. In the interview, Sells claimed to have killed more than 70 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/most-evil/full-episodes/cold-blooded-killers| title=Most Evil: Cold Blooded Killers|date=February 28, 2007|accessdate=December 11, 2018|publisher=[[Investigation Discovery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]] created a 10-minute mini-documentary 'Tommy Lynn Sells - The Mind of a Psychopath'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V7EL-Yg8Gg|title=Tommy Lynn Sells - The Mind of a Psychopath &amp;#124; Nightline &amp;#124; ABC News|date=August 26, 2010|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur John Shawcross''' (June 6, 1945 &amp;ndash; November 10, 2008), also known as the '''[[Genesee River]] Killer''', was an [[Americans|American]] [[serial killer]] active in [[Rochester, New York]].

His first known murders were in 1972 when he killed a young boy and a girl in his hometown of [[Watertown, New York]]. Under the terms of a [[plea bargain]], Shawcross was allowed to plead guilty to one charge of [[manslaughter]], for which he served 14 years of a 25-year sentence. He killed most of his victims in 1988 and 1989 after being [[parole]]d early which led to criticism of the justice system. A food service worker, Shawcross trawled the streets of Rochester in his girlfriend's 1984 sky blue [[Dodge Omni]] (later using her blue-grey 1987 [[Chevy Celebrity]]), looking for sex workers to abduct.

He died in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 2008, while serving a prison sentence of 250 years for his crimes. Dr. [[Michael H. Stone]], professor of psychiatry at [[Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]], and an authority on violent behavior, identified Shawcross as "one of the most egregious examples of the unwarranted release of a prisoner" in his book, ''The Anatomy of Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, MH. ''The Anatomy of Evil''. Prometheus (2009), p. 347. {{ISBN|1591027268}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shawcross was born in [[Kittery, Maine]], the first of four children of Arthur Roy Shawcross and Elizabeth "Bessie" ("Betty") Yerakes Shawcross. His family moved to [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]] in [[New York State]] when he was young. While several later tests showed Shawcross' intelligence to be sub-normal or even "borderline [[mental retardation|retarded]]", he received As and Bs in his first two years of grade school but was later tested to have an I.Q. of 86, signifying below average intelligence.

Shawcross said throughout his childhood, he was a frequent bed-wetter. He later claimed his mother would insert foreign objects into his rectum and that his aunt performed [[oral sex]] on him when he was 9, and that during junior high school he had sexual relations with his sister. Shawcross had a reputation at school as a bully and would frequently act out violently. He dropped out of high school in 1960.

In April 1967 he was drafted by the [[U.S. Army|Army]] at age 21. At this time, Shawcross divorced his first wife and gave up the rights to their 18-month-old son, whom he never saw again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served one tour of duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], where he boasted of grotesque combat exploits, such as "beheading [[mama-san]]s and nailing their heads to trees as a warning to the [[Vietcong]]" — though in fact he never saw combat.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (2009), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Vietnam he was stationed at [[Fort Sill]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] as an [[armorer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife Linda experienced several aspects of his disturbing behavior, especially his penchant for starting fires; an Army [[psychiatrist]] told her that Shawcross derived "sexual enjoyment" from fire starting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to New York==
After his discharge from the Army, Shawcross moved with his wife from Oklahoma to [[Clayton (village), New York|Clayton]], New York. His wife would soon divorce him, and he began committing crimes such as [[arson]] and [[burglary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; His offenses earned him a five-year sentence at [[Attica Correctional Facility]], and later [[Auburn Correctional Facility]].  After serving 22 months he was granted an early release in October 1971, in part due to his role in the rescue of a prison guard during a riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawcross returned to Watertown, eventually getting a job with the Watertown Public Works Department, and marrying for the third time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1972, he [[rape|raped]] and killed 10-year-old Jack Owen Blake, his first known victim, after luring the boy into some woods in Watertown. The body wasn't found until authorities received a tip by phone on September 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Boy's Body Found In Woods|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/136824408/|date=1972-09-08|access-date=2019-06-21|work=Democrat and Chronicle|location=Rochester, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, just prior to the body's discovery, he raped and killed eight-year-old Karen Ann Hill, who had been visiting Watertown with her mother for the [[Labor Day]] weekend. Shawcross was arrested the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=City Girl Strangled, Man Held |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/136823537/ |work=Democrat and Chronicle |location=Rochester, New York |date=1972-09-04 |access-date=2019-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A grand jury indicted Shawcross for murder in Hill's death. On October 17, he was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser charge of first degree manslaughter for both deaths and was sentenced to an indeterminate term at Attica, with a maximum of 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Strom |title=Shawcross Sent to Attica In Child's Death|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36548406/ |work=The Post-Standard |location=Syracuse, New York |date=1972-10-18 |access-date=2019-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jefferson County, New York|Jefferson County]] District Attorney William McClusky explained the plea by stating there was no direct evidence linking Blake and Shawcross, only Shawcross' confession to police. McClusky also suggested Shawcross could have argued at trial that he was under "extreme emotional disturbance", and a jury would have been likely to arrive at a verdict of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bob Strom |title=Shawcross Sent to Attica In Child's Death|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36548406/ |work=The Post-Standard |location=Syracuse, New York |date=1972-10-18 |access-date=2019-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, he was transferred from Attica to [[Green Haven Correctional Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Shawcross Transferred|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36557200/ |work=The Post-Standard |location=Syracuse, New York |date=1972-11-21 |access-date=2019-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fourteen years, inexperienced prison staff and social workers concluded that Shawcross was "no longer dangerous"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside The Mind Of Arthur Shawcross, The 300-Pound "Genesee River Killer" |url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/arthur-shawcross |website=All That's Interesting |date=2018-03-22 |publisher=William DeLong |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, disregarding the warnings of psychiatrists, who had assessed Shawcross as a "[[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] [[psychopath]]".  He was released on parole in April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had difficulty settling down in communities as the neighbors would protest his presence and employers would fire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first moved into [[Binghamton, New York]], then relocated to [[Delhi (town), New York|Delhi, New York]], with his girlfriend, Rose Marie Walley. When Delhi residents became aware of Shawcross' presence, the couple moved to nearby [[Fleischmanns, New York]], only to be met with hostility there as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 1987, Shawcross' [[parole officer]] moved him and Walley into a transient hotel in [[Rochester, New York]], but failed to notify Rochester authorities of this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In mid-October Shawcross and Walley found more permanent lodgings at 241 Alexander Street in Rochester.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second series of murders==
In March 1988, Shawcross began murdering again, primarily [[sex worker]]s in the area (apart from June Stott, who was a local and was the first one of his victims to be mutilated after her death), before his capture less than two years later. He was convicted of 11 murders, with a 12th not officially charged to him.  The victims were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truelifecrimes.com/arthur_shawcross.html "Serial killer profile: Arthur Shawcross"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215071658/http://www.truelifecrimes.com/arthur_shawcross.html |date=2015-12-15 }} www.truelifecrimes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the victims were murdered in [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]], except for Gibson, who was killed in neighboring [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]]. The retired detective [[Robert Keppel]] has argued that the detectives investigating the case over-relied on the concept of ''[[modus operandi]]'', at times searching for multiple suspects due to small differences in the profiles of each victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keppel|2011|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June Cicero's body was discovered by aerial surveillance on January 3, 1990.

Police arrested Shawcross two days later, on January 5, 1990. He had been spotted by a police surveillance team (and by an eyewitness) standing near his car, apparently urinating, on a bridge over Salmon Creek; upon whose frozen waters the body of his final victim was dumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
In November 1990, Shawcross was tried by Monroe County First Assistant District Attorney [[Charles J. Siragusa]] for the 10 murders in Monroe County. Shawcross pleaded [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]], with testimony from psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]] that he had brain damage, [[multiple personality disorder]] (now known as dissociative identity disorder) and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and had been sexually abused as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Foderaro, Lisa W. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/nyregion/a-serial-murder-trial-on-tv-grips-rochester.html "A Serial-Murder Trial, On TV, Grips Rochester"] ''The New York Times''. December 2, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawcross, who had served in Vietnam with the 4th Supply and Transport Company of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; had told many outlandish tales of murderous activities (including [[cannibalism]]), often perpetrated while alone in the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the time Shawcross returned from his tour of duty, he told acquaintances of seeing American soldiers "skinned from their neck to their ankles",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to have decapitated two women he had victimized, "placing" their heads on poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|pp=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] criminal profiler [[Robert K. Ressler]] reviewed the PTSD claim on behalf of the prosecution before the trial. Ressler wrote that "his claim of having witnessed wartime atrocities was patently outrageous and untrue."&lt;ref name="Ressler1"&gt;{{harvnb|Ressler| Schactman|1992|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution psychiatrist Dr. [[Park Dietz]] said Shawcross had [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/multiples/8.html MPD as an organic disorder]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
[[File: Arthur Shawcross et al.jpeg|thumb|Shawcross with his daughter (left) and granddaughter at the [[Sullivan Correctional Facility]], 2002]]
Shawcross was held at the [[Sullivan Correctional Facility]] in [[Fallsburg, New York]], until he died on November 10, 2008, at the Albany Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27665929/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/serial-killer-arthur-shawcross-dead/#.VueiLynyEp4 "Serial killer Arthur Shawcross Dead at 63."] http://www.nbcnews.com. November 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Shawcross was interviewed by [[United Kingdom|British]] reporter Katherine English for a [[documentary film|documentary]] on [[cannibalism]]. Shawcross bragged about slicing out and eating the [[vulva]]s of three victims, but refused to discuss his earlier claim of eating the genitals of his first victim, Jack Blake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olsen|1993|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Officials said Shawcross complained of a pain in his leg on the afternoon of November 10, 2008, his date of death. He was taken to [[Albany Medical Center]], where he went into [[cardiac arrest]]. Shawcross died at 9:50&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Upstate New York serial killer dies : News : CNYcentral.com |url=http://www.cnycentral.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=220323 |website=CNY Central |accessdate=27 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719062622/http://www.cnycentral.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=220323 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Shawcross Biography Murderer (1945–2008)|url=http://www.biography.com/people/arthur-shawcross-15423749|website=www.biography.com|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks|accessdate=15 January 2017|ref=biography.com|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated.

'''Charles Raymond "Charlie" Starkweather''' (November 24, 1938 – June 25, 1959)&lt;ref name="Wishart2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wishart|first=David J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtRFyFO4hpEC&amp;pg=PA462|accessdate=October 22, 2010|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-4787-1|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[spree killer]] who murdered eleven people in [[Nebraska]] and [[Wyoming]] between December 1957 and January 1958, when he was just 19 years old.&lt;ref name="Rule2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rule|first=Ann|title=Kiss Me, Kill Me: Ann Rule's Crime Files|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jtj8_7WxpUkC&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=October 22, 2010|year=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-69139-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; He killed ten of his victims between January 21 and January 29, 1958, the date of his arrest. During his spree in 1958, Starkweather was accompanied by his 14-year-old girlfriend, [[Caril Ann Fugate]].

Both Starkweather and Fugate were convicted on charges for their parts in the homicides; Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed seventeen months after the events. Fugate served seventeen years in prison, gaining release in 1976.&lt;ref name="FlowersFlowers2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flowers|first1=R. Barri|authorlink=R. Barri Flowers|author2=H.

==Early life==
Charles Starkweather was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], the third of seven children of Guy and Helen Starkweather.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;[http://www.biography.com/articles/Charles-Starkweather-233080 Charles Starkweather] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127164522/http://www.biography.com/articles/Charles-Starkweather-233080 |date=November 27, 2010 }}, biography.com; accessed June 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Starkweathers were a working-class family. His father Guy was a mild-mannered carpenter who was often unemployed, due to suffering [[rheumatoid arthritis]] in his hands. During Guy's periods of unemployment, Helen supplemented the family's income working as a waitress.&lt;ref&gt;''Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-752-20850-3}} p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Starkweather attended Saratoga Elementary School, Irving Junior High School, and [[Lincoln High School (Lincoln, Nebraska)|Lincoln High School]]. In contrast to his family life, Starkweather later recalled nothing positive of his time at school.&lt;ref name="karisable"/&gt; He was born with [[genu varum]], a mild [[birth defect]] that caused his legs to be misshapen. He also suffered from a [[speech impediment]], which led to constant teasing by classmates.&lt;ref name="karisable"/&gt;

As he grew older and stronger, the only subject which Starkweather excelled at was gym,&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; where he found a physical outlet for his rage against those who bullied him. Starkweather began to bully those who had once picked on him.&lt;ref name="bookrags"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/charles-starkweather-cri World of Criminal Justice on Charles Starkweather], BookRags.com; accessed June 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he felt rage against anyone he disliked. In this period as a young teenager, Starkweather went from being one of the most well-behaved teenagers in the community to one of the most troubled. His high school friend Bob von Busch would later recall:
{{quote|He could be the kindest person you've ever seen. He'd do anything for you if he liked you. He was a hell of a lot of fun to be around, too. Everything was just one big joke to him. But he had this other side. He could be mean as hell, cruel. If he saw some poor guy on the street who was bigger than he was, better looking, or better dressed, he'd try to take the poor bastard down to his size.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, William. ''Starkweather: The Story of a Mass Murderer''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relationship with Caril Ann Fugate==
{{Main|Caril Ann Fugate}}
In 1956, the 18-year-old Starkweather was introduced to 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate by her older sister, whom he had previously dated. He had dropped out of Lincoln High School in his senior year and was working at a [[Western Union]] newspaper warehouse.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bookrags"/&gt; He sought employment there because the warehouse was located near Whittier Junior High School in Lincoln, where Fugate was a student. Given his working schedule, Starkweather began to visit Caril Ann Fugate every day after school. He was considered a poor worker; his employer later recalled, "Sometimes you'd have to tell him something two or three times. Of all the employees in the warehouse, he was the dumbest man we had."{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Starkweather taught Fugate how to drive, and one day she crashed his [[1949 Ford]] into another car. However, Starkweather's father Guy was the registered owner of the vehicle. He paid the damages but argued with his son about it, and his having let his unlicensed girlfriend drive.  Refusing to condone his son's behavior, Guy banished Starkweather from the family home. The young man quit his job at the warehouse and became a garbage collector at [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

He began developing a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] worldview, believing that his current situation was the final determinant of how he would live the rest of his life. He used his time on the garbage route to begin plotting [[bank robbery|bank robberies]]. He settled on a personal philosophy by which he lived the remainder of his time: "Dead people are all on the same level".&lt;ref&gt;author&lt;!--author ? --&gt;''Born Bad'' &lt;!-- publisher? --&gt;{{ISBN|978-1-87159-262-7}} p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==First murder==
Late on November 30, 1957, Starkweather became angry at Robert Colvert, a service station attendant in Lincoln, for refusing to sell him a stuffed animal on credit (most purchases were made by cash.) He returned several times during the night to purchase small items, until finally, brandishing a shotgun, he forced Colvert to give him $100 from the till. He drove Colvert to a remote area, where they struggled over the gun, injuring Colvert before Starkweather killed him with a shot to the head.&lt;ref name="karisable"/&gt;

==1958 murder spree==
On January 21, 1958, Starkweather went to Fugate's home to get his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="Wishart2004"/&gt; Fugate's mother and stepfather, Velda and Marion Bartlett, told him to stay away. He fatally shot them, then strangled and stabbed to death their two-year-old daughter Betty Jean.&lt;ref name=karisable&gt;[http://karisable.com/skazfulgate.htm Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate], retrieved (December 9, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He hid the bodies behind the house.

Starkweather later said that Caril was there the entire time, but she said that when she arrived home, Starkweather met her with a gun and said that her family was being held hostage. She said Starkweather told her that if she cooperated with him, her family would be safe; otherwise, they would be killed. The pair remained in the house until shortly before the police, alerted by Fugate's suspicious grandmother, arrived on January 27.&lt;ref name=karisable/&gt;

Starkweather and Fugate drove to the farmhouse of seventy-year-old August Meyer, one of her family's friends who lived in [[Bennet, Nebraska]]. Starkweather killed him with a shotgun blast to the head.&lt;ref name="karisable"/&gt; He also killed Meyer's dog.&lt;ref&gt;Leyton, Elliot. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=qx4UUPitJ-TE4gSLuYHQBg&amp;hl=de&amp;id=js73x02HJ80C ''Hunting Humans'' (p. 205)]; Pocket Books (1988); {{ISBN|9780671659615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleeing the area, the pair drove their car into mud and abandoned the vehicle. When Robert Jensen and Carol King, two local teenagers, stopped to give them a ride, Starkweather forced them to drive back to an abandoned [[storm cellar]] in Bennet. He shot Jensen in the back of the head. He attempted to [[rape]] King, but was unable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Born Bad'' {{ISBN|978-1-87159-262-7}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; He became angry with her and fatally shot her as well. Starkweather later admitted shooting Jensen, but claimed that Fugate shot King. Fugate said she had stayed in the car the entire time. The two fled Bennet in Jensen's car.{{fact|date=December 2019}}

Starkweather and Fugate drove to a wealthy section of Lincoln, where they entered the home of industrialist C. Lauer Ward and his wife Clara.&lt;ref name="karisable"/&gt; Starkweather stabbed their maid Lillian Fencl to death, then waited for Lauer and Clara to return home. Starkweather killed the family dog by breaking its neck, to keep it from alerting the Wards. Clara arrived first alone, and was also stabbed to death. Starkweather later admitted to having thrown a knife at Clara, but insisted that Fugate had stabbed her numerous times, killing her. When Lauer Ward returned home that evening, Starkweather shot and killed him. Starkweather and Fugate filled Ward's black 1956 [[Packard]] with stolen jewelry from the house and fled Nebraska.{{fact|date=December 2019}}

The murders of the Wards and Fencl caused an uproar within [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]].&lt;ref name=karisable/&gt; Law enforcement agencies in the region sent their officers on a house-to-house search for the perpetrators. [[Governor of Nebraska|Governor]] [[Victor Emanuel Anderson]] contacted the [[Nebraska National Guard]], and the Lincoln chief of police called for a block-by-block search of that city. After several sightings of Starkweather and Fugate were reported, the Lincoln Police Department was accused of incompetence for being unable to capture the pair.{{fact|date=December 2019}}

Needing a new car because of Ward's Packard having been identified, the couple came upon traveling salesman Merle Collison sleeping in his [[Buick]] along the highway outside [[Douglas, Wyoming|Douglas]], [[Wyoming]]. After Collison was awakened, he was fatally shot. Starkweather later accused Fugate of performing a [[coup-de-grace]] after his shotgun jammed. Starkweather claimed Fugate was the "most trigger happy person" he had ever met. Fugate denied ever having killed anyone.{{fact|date=December 2019}}

The salesman's car had a [[parking brake]], which was something new to Starkweather. While he attempted to drive away, the car stalled because the brake had not been released. He tried to restart the engine, and a passing motorist stopped to help. Starkweather threatened him with the rifle, and an altercation ensued. At that moment, a deputy sheriff arrived on the scene. Fugate ran to him, yelling something to the effect of: "It's Starkweather! He's going to kill me!"{{fact|date=December 2019}}

Starkweather drove off and tried to evade the police, exceeding speeds of {{convert|100|mph}}. A bullet shattered the windshield and flying glass cut Starkweather deep enough to cause bleeding. He stopped and surrendered. Converse County Sheriff Earl Heflin said, "He thought he was bleeding to death. That's why he stopped. That's the kind of [[cowardice|yellow]] son of a bitch he is."&lt;ref&gt;Joe McGowan, "Youth Who Slew Ten Captured in Wyoming", [[Associated Press]] report, in Alton (IL) ''Evening Telegraph'', January 30, 1958, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Starkweather chose to be extradited from Wyoming to Nebraska. He and Fugate arrived there in late January 1958. He believed that either state would have executed him. He was not aware that [[Milward Simpson]], [[Governor of Wyoming|Wyoming's governor]] at the time, opposed the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/starkweather/reckoning_9.html Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130004948/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/starkweather/reckoning_9.html |date=November 30, 2013 }}, trutv.com; accessed June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Starkweather first said that he had kidnapped Fugate and that she had nothing to do with the murders. However, he changed his story several times. He testified against her at her trial, saying that she was a [[Accomplice|willing participant]].{{fact|date=December 2019}}

Fugate has always maintained that Starkweather was holding her hostage by threatening to kill her family, claiming she was unaware they were already dead. Judge Harry A. Spencer did not believe Fugate was held hostage by Starkweather, as he determined she had had numerous opportunities to escape. When Starkweather was first taken to the Nebraska penitentiary after his trial, he said that he believed that he was supposed to die. He said if he was to be executed, then Fugate should be also.&lt;ref&gt;''Born Bad'' {{ISBN|978-1-87159-262-7}} pp. 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Starkweather was convicted for the murder of Jensen, the only murder for which he was tried. He was sentenced to death, and executed by the [[electric chair]] at the [[Nebraska State Penitentiary]] in Lincoln, Nebraska, at 12:04&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 25, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starkweather Executed: Calm To The End, No Final Words|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19590625&amp;id=JXhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Jz8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2949,2692488|accessdate=April 28, 2014|newspaper=The Miami News|page=1-A|date=June 25, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Wyuka Cemetery]] in Lincoln along with five of his victims, including Mr. and Mrs. Carl Ward.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Ed.  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/Wyuka_Cemetery_Tour.pdf  "Wyuka Cemetery: A Driving &amp; Walking Tour"], nebraskahistory.org; accessed June 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.shtml Nebraska State Historical Society website], nebraskahistory.org; retrieved June 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fugate was convicted as an accomplice and received a [[life sentence]] on November 21, 1958. She was paroled in June 1976 after serving 17½ years at the [[Nebraska Correctional Center for Women]] in [[York, Nebraska]]. She settled in [[Lansing, Michigan]].

'''William Lester Suff''' (born August 20, 1950, as '''Bill Lee Suff'''), also known as the '''Riverside Prostitute Killer''' and the '''Lake Elsinore Killer,''' is an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]].

==Early crimes==
In 1974, a [[Texas]] jury convicted Suff and his then-wife, Teryl, of beating their two-month-old daughter to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/bcadc25a1a7aa5deb785225bd7729ca3|title=Man Charged in Two Deaths Lost Custody of Infant|date=January 15, 1992|last=Elber|first=Lynn|website=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] later reversed Teryl's conviction but upheld Suff's in ''Suff v. State'' (Tex. 1976) 531 S.W.2d 814, finding insufficient evidence to convict her as either the primary actor or a principal in their baby's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/court-of-criminal-appeals/1976/51152-3.html|title=Suff v. State|website=Justia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Suff was sentenced to 70 years in a Texas [[prison]], he served only ten years before his 1984 release on [[parole]]. He is currently incarcerated at [[San Quentin]] after having been convicted of killing twelve women in [[California]] and receiving the [[death penalty]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pe.com/2014/04/28/riverside-county-death-penalty-upheld-for-serial-killer-william-suff/|title=RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Death penalty upheld for serial killer William Suff|date=April 28, 2014|last=De Atley|first=Richard|website=The Press-Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Suff subsequently [[rape]]d, tortured, stabbed, strangled, and sometimes mutilated 12 or more women in [[Riverside County]], between June 28, 1989, and December 23, 1991. On January 9, 1992, Suff was arrested after a routine traffic stop after a police officer found a bloody knife and objects believed to be related to the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-20/news/mn-26054_1_riverside-county|title=Riverside Man Convicted in Serial Slayings|last=Gorman|first=Tom|date=July 20, 1995|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as a mild-mannered loner, Suff worked as a warehouse clerk for Riverside County when he was arrested, having been hired while still on parole from Texas. During his time in this job, Suff delivered office furniture to the officers on the task force investigating his killing spree. It was alleged that he once used the [[breast]] of one of his victims in a chili contest and won.&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;{{cite web | last =Lohr | first =David | title =The Riverside Prostitute Killer | work =Crime Library | publisher =truTV | date = | url =http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/bill_suff/8.html | accessdate = 28 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kyvtoHXBIK4C&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=William+Lester+Suff+riverside#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Lester%20Suff%20riverside&amp;f=false |title = Inside the Outside|isbn = 9780615440293|last1 = Lastrapes|first1 = Martin|date = 2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
On July 19, 1995, a Riverside County jury found Suff guilty of killing 12 women and attempting to kill another, though police suspected him responsible for as many as 22 deaths. Suff did not testify in his own defense. During the penalty phase that followed, the prosecutor presented evidence linking Suff to the 1988 murder of a [[San Bernardino]] woman, as well as evidence that despite his prior Texas prison term for murdering his first daughter, he abused and violently shook his three-month-old daughter by his second wife. On August 17, 1995, after deliberating for only 10 minutes, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on 12 murder counts and on one count of attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDC113DF933A1575BC0A963958260 "Jury Asks for Death Penalty for Convicted Killer of 12 Women,"] New York Times, August 20, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury could not unanimously agree to find him guilty on a 13th count of murder. On October 26, 1995, the trial court followed the jury's verdict and ordered Suff [[capital punishment|condemned to death]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E0D71F39F93AA15753C1A963958260 "Killer of Prostitutes Gets Death Sentence,"] New York Times, October 29, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Suff resides on death row at [[San Quentin State Prison]].

His 2014 appeal of the sentence was rejected by the [[California Supreme Court]] which upheld the death penalty.

==Book and TV==
''The Riverside Killer'' by Christine Keers and Dennis St Pierre was published in 1996 by Pinnacle True Crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yh0KAAAACAAJ | title=The Riverside Killer| isbn=9780786003457| last1=Keers| first1=Christine| last2=Pierre| first2=Dennis St| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 ''Cat and Mouse - Mind Games with a Serial Killer'' was published by Dove Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/brian-alan-with-william-suff-lane/cat-and-mouse-mind-games-with-a-serial-killer/|title=CAT AND MOUSE: Mind Games with a Serial Killer|author=Brian Alan|date=April 1, 1997|website=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suff met with author Brian Alan Lane and told his story. The book includes short stories and poems written by Suff and photos of several of his victims.

'''Anthony Allen Shore''' (June 25, 1962 – January 18, 2018) was an American [[serial killer]] and [[child molester]] who was responsible for the murder of one woman and three girls. He was active from 1986 to 2000, and became known as the "Tourniquet Killer" because of his use of a [[Strangling#Ligature strangulation|ligature]] with either a toothbrush or bamboo stick to tighten or loosen the ligature. The instrument was similar to a [[Twitch (device)|twitch]], a tool used by farmers to control horses.&lt;ref name="mitchell" /&gt; Shore was sentenced to death in 2004, and executed by lethal injection on January 18, 2018.

On October 19, 1993, Shore entered the home of 14-year-old Selma Janske, then bound and sexually assaulted her; however, he did not kill her, and instead fled the scene on foot.&lt;ref name="janske" /&gt;

===Diana Rebollar===
Diana Rebollar, 9, was killed on August 8, 1994. She had been beaten, sexually assaulted and strangled.&lt;ref name="tcca" /&gt; She lived in the [[Houston Heights]] area of Houston, at the front of a small duplex. The day of her death, she was seen at a local grocery store. Employees saw her leave the store safely, but she never returned home. She was found the next day on a loading dock behind a building.&lt;ref name="tcca" /&gt; One lead for police was given by a neighbor who described a van that frequented the area. She was connected to the Maria del Carmen Estrada case by the killer's ''[[modus operandi]]'': a rope with a bamboo stick attached was found around her neck.&lt;ref name="tcca" /&gt;

===Dana Sanchez===
Dana Sanchez, 16, was killed on July 6, 1995. Shore offered her a ride in his van. He made advances to her, which she resisted; she was then strangled. Seven days later, an anonymous telephone call to a local news station, actually made by Shore, directed police to her body in a Harris County field.&lt;ref name="tcca" /&gt;

==Investigation==
In 1998, Shore was convicted of molesting his two daughters, Tiffany and Amber, and as a result he was required to provide police with a DNA sample.&lt;ref name="press040729" /&gt; In 2000, detectives pulled Maria del Carmen Estrada's case from the cold files, tested DNA evidence from underneath Estrada's fingernails, and received a full genetic profile.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt; The results were not immediately matched to Shore because of problems at the lab.&lt;ref name="press040729" /&gt; As a result of an audit, the lab was closed in 2002; certain samples, however, including those taken from Estrada's nails, were sent to another laboratory for retesting.&lt;ref name="press040729" /&gt; The results were not matched until 2003, which led to Shore's arrest for Estrada's murder.&lt;ref name="press040729" /&gt;

Eleven hours into his interrogation, Shore confessed to the murders of Maria del Carmen Estrada, Diana Rebollar, and Dana Sanchez. He also confessed to the 1987 murder of fourteen-year-old Laurie Tremblay and the 1994 rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. Detectives had no way of linking this killing to the other three murders because Tremblay was strangled with a ligature. When asked why he switched to a tourniquet, Shore replied, "because I hurt my finger while murdering Tremblay."&lt;ref name="mitchell" /&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
Despite Shore's confession to the murders of four people and the rape of another, prosecutor Kelly Siegler decided to charge Shore for only Estrada's murder, because it contained the most forensic evidence. His trial began in late October 2004. The jury found Shore guilty of [[capital murder]]. During the sentencing phase, Shore's only surviving victim testified. After less than an hour of deliberations, the jury recommended that Shore be put to death, which Shore himself had asked for. He was sentenced to death on November 15, 2004.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Anthony Edward Sowell''' (born August 19, 1959) is an American [[serial killer]] known as the '''Cleveland Strangler'''. He was arrested in October 2009 after the bodies of eleven women were discovered by police investigators at his home, 12205 Imperial Avenue, in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name="bodies"&gt;{{cite news| work=BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8335859.stm|title=Six bodies at US rapist's house |date=October 31, 2009  | accessdate=November 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anthony Edward Sowell was raised in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]], one of seven children born to single parent Claudia "Gertude" Garrison. Seven other children belonging to Sowell's sister also lived in the household, having moved in after her death following a chronic illness. According to Sowell's niece, Garrison subjected them to physical abuse while her own children watched from adjacent rooms. In one incident, Garrison forced Sowell's niece to strip naked in front of the other children, then whipped her with electrical cords until she bled. Sowell himself began raping his niece on an almost daily basis for two years, starting when she was 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/08/serial_killer_anthony_sowell_began_raping_niece_when_both_were_children_witness_testifies.html Serial killer Anthony Sowell began raping niece when both were children, witness testifies], Cleveland ''Plain-Dealer'', 2 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
On January 24, 1978, at the age of 19, Sowell entered the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He attended recruit training at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[South Carolina]], then was further trained as an [[electrician]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. On July 13, 1978, he was assigned to the [[2nd Marine Aircraft Wing]] at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]], also in North Carolina. In 1980, Sowell spent a year overseas with the [[3rd Marine Logistics Group|3rd Force Service Support Group]], then returned to Cherry Point.&lt;ref name="marine"/&gt;

He was then ordered to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Butler]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] on January 20, 1984. A year later, he transferred to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] in [[California]] for three days until his discharge on January 18, 1985. During his seven-year Marine Corps career, Corporal Sowell received a [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]] with one [[service star]], a [[Sea Service Ribbon|Sea Service Deployment Ribbon]], a Certificate of Commendation, a [[Mast (naval)|Meritorious Mast]], and two Letters of Appreciation.&lt;ref name="marine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enctoday.com/news/serial-6305-havelock-killer-sowell.html |title=Marine Corps says accused serial killer stationed twice at Cherry Point and once at Camp Lejeune |work=[[Havelock, North Carolina|Havelock]] News |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109105933/http://www.enctoday.com/news/serial-6305-havelock-killer-sowell.html |archivedate=November 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1989 attack, incarceration, and release ==
In 1989, Melvette Sockwell, who was three months pregnant, went to Sowell's home voluntarily. When she tried to leave, he bound her hands and feet with a tie and belt, then gagged her with a rag. The victim told police: "He choked me real hard because my body started tingling. I thought I was going to die."&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt;  Sowell was charged with kidnapping, rape and attempted rape. He eventually plead guilty to the charge of attempted rape, and as a result he served 15 years in prison. He was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/anthony_sowell_was_considered.html|title=Anthony Sowell was considered unlikely to attack again in 2005 evaluation|date=2009-11-05|work=CBS News|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sowell worked in a factory until 2007 when he began collecting unemployment benefits.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt;  Neighbors said he earned a living selling scrap metal.&lt;ref name="bodies"/&gt;  They complained to the health department of a foul smell in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt; He was a member of an online dating service, where he stated that he was a "master" looking for a submissive person to "train".&lt;ref name="evenMoreBodies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/02/crimesider/entry5495923.shtml|title=Anthony Sowell Cruised Sex Fetish Site While Dead Bodies Rotted in His Cleveland Home|date=November 4, 2009|work=CBS News|accessdate=November 4, 2009 | first=Edecio | last=Martinez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Frazier, a niece of Cleveland Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]], began a relationship with Sowell shortly after his release from prison and resided in his home. She claims to have smelled the stench of decaying bodies and that she was told the smell was coming from Sowell's stepmother. When she moved out, she claimed that the smell was from Ray's Sausage Shop, located next door to the Sowell residence. There is some confusion about when Frazier stopped living in Sowell's home. In a video interview she mentions moving out in 2007, but in a published article she is said to have been living there until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/11/11/crimesider/entry5616478.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Mayor's Niece Lived With Alleged "Cleveland Strangler" Anthony Sowell and Rotting Bodies | first=Ryan | last=Smith | date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another article quotes a friend of Frazier's stating that Frazier stopped spending time at Sowell's home in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Phillip.

==Discovery of bodies and arrest==
In September 2009,&lt;ref name="marine"/&gt; Sowell invited Latundra Billups to his home for a drink.  On September 22, 2009, she reported to police that after a few drinks, he became angry, hit her, choked her and raped her as she passed out. On October 29, police arrived at his home with a warrant to arrest him for the alleged rape.  He was not there, but he was located and arrested two days later.&lt;ref name="marine"/&gt;

The bodies of two women were buried in a shallow grave in the basement and four other women were found on the 3rd floor of the home, in crawl spaces in the house.&lt;ref name="moreBodies"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/crews_again_digging_at_anthony.html | title=Police discover 10 victims at Anthony Sowell's home | date=November 3, 2009 | work=Cleveland Metro | accessdate=November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After digging in the backyard, investigators found three more bodies and the remains of a fourth. Police also found a human skull in a bucket inside the house, which brought the body count to eleven. Most of the victims were killed by manual strangulation and others were gagged or had ligatures on their bodies when they were discovered.&lt;ref name="skull"/&gt;

Sowell also had at least three more rape victims that he had actually let live. All three never reported the attacks, due to their prior drug history or other personal reasons. Many victims were led to his property with an invitation to smoke [[crack cocaine]] with him. He was a known drug user throughout his neighborhood.

At the time of his arrest, Sowell was 50 years old. He had been living at that location for four years.&lt;ref name="skull"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6903700.ece | date = November 5, 2009 | title = Skull in a basket as police search Anthony Sowell's home for more bodies | work = The Times | accessdate = November 5, 2009 | location=London | first=James | last=Boneand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was held on $5 million bond.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt; His trial was originally supposed to start on June 2, 2010&lt;ref name="Anthony Sowell accused of killing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/05/anthony_sowell_accused_of_kill.html|title=Anthony Sowell accused of killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

then to May 2 at the request of Sowell's defense attorneys who needed more time to comb through thousands of records and hours of surveillance video footage shot from the property next door to Sowell's Imperial Avenue home, where the remains of 11 women were discovered in 2009,&lt;ref name="Trial for serial killing suspended"/&gt; and later to June 6 at the request of the prosecution due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name="Trial for serial killing suspended"/&gt; The trial eventually began on June 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Crow |last= Chuck | work=The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/06/pleasant_conversations_with_anthony_sowell_turned_violent_without_warning_three_women_testify.html |title=Pleasant conversations with Anthony Sowell turned violent without warning, 3 women testify |publisher= cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Leila | last=Atassi |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/suspected_serial-killer_anthony_sowell_told_police_he_punished_drug_addicted_women_interrogation_vid.html|title=Suspected serial killer Anthony Sowell told police he 'punished' drug-addicted women, interrogation video reveals |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Leila | last=Atassi |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_hinted_at_yet_undiscovered_horrors_police_sergeant_testifies.html |title=Anthony Sowell hinted at yet undiscovered horrors, police sergeant testifies |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_trial_surviving_family_members_of_imperial_avenue_killings_recount_their_anguish.html |title=Anthony Sowell trial: Surviving family members of Imperial Avenue killings recount their anguish |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Michael | last= Scott | work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/more_grotesque_detail_expected_in_third_week_of_anthony_sowell_capital_murder_trial.html |title=More 'grotesque' detail expected in third week of Anthony Sowell capital murder trial |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell_admitted_to_stashing_bodies_in_imperial_avenue_home_neighbor_testifies.html |title=Anthony Sowell admitted to stashing bodies in Imperial Avenue home, neighbor testifies |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott | last= Shaw |work= The Plain Dealer |url= http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/nurse_takes_stand_in_anthony_sowell_serial_murder_trial_describes_taking_dna_evidence.html |title=Nurse takes stand in Anthony Sowell serial murder trial, describes taking DNA evidence |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/news/crime/bodies_found/day-16-anthony-sowell-trial |title=Day 16: Anthony Sowell trial |publisher=Newsnet5.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143044/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/crime/bodies_found/day-16-anthony-sowell-trial |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Marvin |last= Fong |work= The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/judge_acquits_serial-killings_defendant_anthony_sowell_on_2_of_85_counts_state_rests_its_case.html |title=Judge acquits serial-killings defendant Anthony Sowell on 2 of 85 counts, state rests its case |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Michael | last= Scott |url=http://www.cleveland.com/anthony-sowell/index.ssf/2011/07/anthony_sowell.html |title=Week one of Anthony Sowell trial hard on victims' families: video interview with PD's Stan Donaldson |publisher=cleveland.com |work= The Plain Dealer| date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction, sentencing, and appeals==
Sowell was charged with eleven counts of [[aggravated murder]] and 74 counts of [[rape]], [[kidnapping]], [[tampering with evidence]], and [[abuse of a corpse]]. He pleaded [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] but later changed his plea to simply "not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=CNN | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,571519,00.html | title='House of horrors' suspect due in court | date=March 24, 2010 | accessdate=March 24, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107095409/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,571519,00.html | archive-date=November 7, 2009 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22, 2011, he was convicted on all but two counts against him, including the murders of the eleven women whose bodies were found in his house in 2009.

In November 2011, Sowell's lawyers, Jeffry F. Kelleher and Thomas Rein, filed a Notice of Appeal with the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]].  Sowell's execution was set for October 29, 2012, but in March 2012, a Motion for Stay of Execution was filed; the motion was granted in April, pending final disposition of the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case No. 2011-1921 Entry |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=April 2, 2012|url=http://supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=191130.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, Sowell's new lawyers, Jeffrey M. Gamso and Erika Cunliffe of the Cuyahoga County Public Defender's office, appealed to have his conviction and death sentence overturned on 21 points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APPELLANT'S REPLY BRIEF AND ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=April 25, 2013 |url=http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=726248.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the main three being:

*that Sowell did not receive a fair trial because of the extensive media coverage. The "media attention was overwhelming, generating thousands of news stories, and…local coverage was 'both frenzied and sustained.'"&lt;ref name=Krouse2013&gt;{{cite web |title =Anthony Sowell's attorneys dispute prosecutors' claims that serial killer got fair trial |work=Northeast Ohio Media Group  |publisher=cleveland.com |date = April 26, 2013 |author=Peter Krouse |url = http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/04/anthony_sowells_attorneys_refu.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*and that he had received "lousy legal representation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Serial killer Anthony Sowell was given a fair trial, Cuyahoga County prosecutors claim in court filing |work=Northeast Ohio Media Group  |publisher=cleveland.com |date=March 12, 2013 |author=Peter Krouse |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/03/serial_killer_anthony_sowell_was_given.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sowell's trial attorneys should have had their client plead guilty to killing the women and then focus their efforts on preventing Sowell from getting the death penalty."&lt;ref name=Krouse2013 /&gt;

In September 2014, the court asked both parties to address three issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case No. 2011-1921 Entry |publisher=Supreme Court of Ohio |date=September 3, 2014 |url=http://supremecourt.ohio.gov/pdf_viewer/pdf_viewer.aspx?pdf=199920.pdf |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments from Sowell's appellant attorneys and the Cuyahoga County D.A. representing the State of Ohio regarding the merits of the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing prior to Sowell's trial, and the defendant's right to a fair and public trial. The attorneys representing Sowell argued that Sowell's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right was violated by closing the Suppression Hearing to the press, and that the Court should commute his Death Sentence to Life-In-Prison as a remedy to the structural error that resulted in the violation. They also argued that counsel had made errors, and "urged the Ohio Supreme Court to send the case back to Cuyahoga County for a retrial. 'Frankly we blew it,' attorney Jeffrey Gamso told the Ohio Supreme Court."&lt;ref name=Borchardt&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthony Sowell's lawyer asks Ohio Supreme Court to save his life |publisher=cleveland.com |date=April 5, 2016 |author=Jackie Borchardt |url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/04/anthony_sowell.html |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State argued that if Sowell's Sixth Amendment right was violated via the closed pre-trial Suppression Hearing it would not have affected the outcome of the trial, as the evidence was overwhelming, and that "Sowell's attorneys were the ones who asked multiple times in his presence for the jury selection to be done privately, without cameras in the courtroom."&lt;ref name=Dissell /&gt; The State also asserted that Sowell has never denied his guilt, and that the heinous nature of his crimes—coupled with little mitigating evidence to deny imposing the death penalty—warrants affirming the death sentence.&lt;ref name=Borchardt /&gt;

On December 8, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Anthony Sowell, affirming his aggravated murder convictions and death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/12/ohio_supreme_court_upholds_con.html|title=Ohio Supreme Court upholds convictions of mass murderer Anthony Sowell|work=cleveland.com|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Sowell appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/05/anthony_sowell_appeals_case_to.html|title=Anthony Sowell appeals case to U.S. Supreme Court|work=cleveland.com|date=May 25, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-sowell-notorious-cleveland-serial-killer-appeals-case-to-supreme-court/|title=Anthony Sowell, notorious Cleveland serial killer, appeals case to Supreme Court|work=CBS NEWS|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court said that it would not review Sowell's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2017/10/us_supreme_court_will_not_hear.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court will not hear Cleveland mass murderer Anthony Sowell's appeal|work=cleveland.com|date=October 2, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court denied a request by Sowell to reopen his appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/02/ohio_supreme_court_wont_reopen.html|title=Ohio Supreme Court won't reopen Anthony Sowell appeal|work=cleveland.com|date=February 14, 2018|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
On November 5, 2009, two of the eleven victims were identified. The first to be identified was Tonia Carmichael, a 53-year-old [[African American]] woman who had disappeared more than a year earlier. Her body was found buried in his backyard. She appeared to have been strangled and was identified through the use of DNA evidence. Her mother had reported her missing in December 2008.&lt;ref name="firstID"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2009/11/05/2009-11-05_police_id_first_of_11_victims_found_decomposing_in_anthony_sowells_cleveland_hom.html | title = Police ID first of 11 victims found decomposing in Anthony Sowell's Ohio home as Tonia Carmichael | date=November 5, 2009 | work=New York Daily News | accessdate=November 5, 2009 | first=Brian | last=Kates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second victim was identified as Telacia Fortson, a 31-year-old African American woman who had disappeared five months earlier. Although she had been missing since June, her mother did not report her missing until she heard the news coverage regarding the dead bodies discovered in Sowell's home.&lt;ref name="2ndVic"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.woio.com/Global/story.asp?S=11452010 | title = 2nd Victim: Cuyahoga County Coroner ID's Second Imperial Body | work = [[WIOO]] Action News | date = 5 November 2009 | accessdate = 2009-11-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091108134441/http://www.woio.com/Global/story.asp?S=11452010# | archive-date = 2009-11-08 | url-status=dead | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2009, three more bodies were identified.  Crystal Dozier was a 38-year-old African American woman who went missing in May 2007. Dozier, the mother of seven children, lived in the area where her body was discovered. Her family reported her missing to the Cleveland Police Department. This was not the first time she had gone missing, and the family accused the police of failing to investigate. The family took it upon themselves to post fliers and call hospitals.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Baird | first = Gabriel | title = Names put to three more victims in Anthony Sowell case | newspaper = The Plain Dealer | location = Cleveland, Ohio | publisher = Cleveland Live | date = 8 November 2009 | url = http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/names_put_to_three_more_victim.html  | accessdate = 2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amelda "Amy" Hunter was a 47-year-old African American woman. Hunter, a beautician and a mother of three, did not live in the area where her body was found, but she did visit frequently. A previous injury left her unable to use one of her arms. Her family did not report her missing until after police began removing bodies from Sowell's house.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;

Michelle Mason was a 45-year-old African American woman who was last seen in October 2008. She lived in the area where her body was found. According to records, the police conducted a full investigation when her family reported her missing.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;

Records of missing persons going back to Sowell's June 2005 release from prison were searched and [[DNA testing]] was conducted on the bodies found at Sowell's house. Protesters holding posters of missing loved ones gathered outside his home at the time.&lt;ref name="bodies"/&gt;

[[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]] police also reopened several [[cold case (criminology)|cold case]]s from the late 1980s.  The murders by strangulation used a similar [[modus operandi]] and had stopped around 1989, the same time that Sowell was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/news_article.aspx?storyid=124851&amp;catid=45 "East Cleveland: Did suspected serial killer also strike in 1989?"], [[WKYC]]-TV, 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI]] at the time was gathering information to see if Sowell may have been linked to unsolved cases in cities where he once lived.&lt;ref name="ThreeMore"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2009/11/09/2009-11-09_anthony_sowell_murder_case_goes_worldwide.html#ixzz0ctHtIHZ5 | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Anthony Sowell rape and murder case goes international | first=Soraya | last=Roberts | date=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heriberto Seda''' (born July 31, 1967) is an American [[serial killer]] who struck [[New York City]] from 1990 to 1993. Before being caught on June 18, 1996, Seda killed three people and wounded five others (four critically). Seda is believed to have admired [[San Francisco]]'s [[Zodiac Killer]] for avoiding capture. Police described Seda, a Brooklyn resident, as a recluse obsessed with astrology and death. Seda was formally charged in the case on June 21, 1996, convicted in 1998, and sentenced to 232 years imprisonment.

==Crimes==
Seda attacked people throughout New York City, sending taunting messages to the police and media after each crime. The messages included codes based on [[International maritime signal flags]], which ''[[New York Post]]'' journalist [[Kieran_Crowley_(writer) | Kieran Crowley]] decoded with the assistance of his father-in-law, a veteran of [[World War II cryptography]] and [[signals intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"&gt;Crowley, Keiran (2003). ''Sleep My Little Dead: The True Story of the Zodiac Killer''. St Martin's Paperbacks&lt;/ref&gt;

The killer's letters to police claimed that he was selecting his victims based on their signs of the [[zodiac]], and implied he would act only at certain times when specific stars were visible in the night sky. Police consulted a professional astronomer, whose predictions about when the killer would strike proved somewhat accurate.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; He used an [[improvised firearm]], explaining in his messages that the lack of rifling marks on the shells would prevent his capture.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt;

New York police considered the possibility that the notorious [[Zodiac Killer]] may have relocated to the East Coast and resumed his crimes after two decades of inactivity. In the late 1960s the Zodiac Killer murdered at least five people and injured another two in the San Francisco area. He sent taunting letters and coded messages to local media, and was never identified. However, a handwriting analyst and consultation with California authorities ruled out that possibility.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt;

==Capture==
In March 1994, Seda was arrested for possession of a deadly weapon after police noticed a suspicious bulge in his jacket pocket that concealed one of his zip guns.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; Police determined that the weapon was not functional, and Seda's [[public defender]] managed to get all charges dropped and his arrest record sealed. Seda interpreted this turn of events as an [[omen]], proving that he was beyond consequences.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt;

At 26 years of age, Seda was an unemployed high school drop out, living with his mother and half-sister.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; He had been a good high school student, but was expelled after bringing a [[starter pistol]] to school.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; He had dropped out rather than attend mandatory counseling sessions to be readmitted to school.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; He was unemployed and supported by his mother, but obtained money by stealing coins from pay phones and vending machines.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt;

Seda was [[Psychological abuse|mentally]] and [[Physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his teenage half-sister, Gladys "Chachi" Reyes. During a confrontation with her and her boyfriend on June 18, 1996, Seda pulled out a weapon and began threatening the couple. While Reyes' boyfriend hid in the bedroom, she tried to escape through the front door, but Seda shot her in the buttocks. Wounded but not incapacitated, she made her way to her neighbor's apartment where she called the police.

After an hours-long stand-off with the police, Seda gave up his firearms and was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Lynda|last= Richardson|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Suspect Is Charged in 4 Zodiac Cases in Queens |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E6DC1539F931A15755C0A960958260 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=June 22, 1996 |accessdate=2008-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and trial==
Authorities initially made no connection between Seda's arrest for the family violence incident, and the string of unsolved murders. However, he closed his handwritten statement about the family incident with a symbol resembling one written on the taunting letters to the police by the unidentified killer.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt;

From here, police focused on Seda as a suspect. Despite the killer's claim that he could never be linked to the crimes due to the lack of rifling on the improvised guns, police were able to use tool-mark evidence to link Seda to the attacks. Fingerprint evidence was also found, and handwriting analysis determined a strong similarity between Seda's statement and the anonymous letters.&lt;ref name="Crowley2003"/&gt; Most damning, police found Seda's DNA on one of the stamps that had been used to mail a letter to police.&lt;ref name="Toy1998"/&gt;

Seda caused repeated disruptions in court, making outbursts and shouting at the judge.&lt;ref name="Toy1998"&gt;Vivian S. Toy (May 15, 1998). [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/15/nyregion/man-said-to-be-zodiac-killer-becomes-enraged-at-trial.html Man Said to Be Zodiac Killer Becomes Enraged at Trial], ''The New York Times''. Retrieved 25 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 1998, Seda was convicted by a jury after a six-week trial, presided over by the Honorable Robert J. Hanophy, Justice of the State Supreme Court for the County of Queens, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Toy |first1=Vivian S. |title=Brooklyn Man Is Guilty In Three Zodiac Killings |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/25/nyregion/brooklyn-man-is-guilty-in-three-zodiac-killings.html |accessdate=October 7, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=June 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was prosecuted by Assistant District Attorneys Robert J. Masters and Raymond E. Scheer. The prosecution presented testimony of 45 witnesses, and introduced 150 pieces of evidence. Seda was represented by court appointed attorneys David A. Bart and John S. Wallenstein.

'''Auto Shankar''' (January 21, 1954 – April 27, 1995) is the [[nickname]] of [[India]]n [[serial killer]] '''Gowri Shankar'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=K.M.|title=The mass murderer of Madras|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EoZlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mZ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=auto%20shankar&amp;pg=1032%2C3469058|accessdate=2 January 2013|agency=[[The Indian Express]]|date=9 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auto Shankar, two others sentenced to death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PIxlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q54NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=817%2C2582855|accessdate=2 January 2013|agency=[[The Indian Express]]|date=1 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Shankar and his gang, consisting of his younger brother Auto Mohan and associates Eldin and Shivaji, as well as Jayavelu, Rajaraman, Ravi, Palani and Paramasivam, were found guilty of six murders, committed over a period of two years in 1988–1989.&lt;ref name="Brother"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/26/stories/2005112620501000.htm The Hindu :   Auto Shankar's brother gets life imprisonment]&lt;/ref&gt; They were tried for the murders of Lalitha, Sudalai, Sampath, Mohan, Govindaraj and Ravi.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt; The bodies of the victims were either burnt or buried inside residential houses.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt;

==Trial==
Shankar's trial was held at the [[Chengalpattu]] sessions court.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt; He was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] along with two of his associates, Eldin and Shivaji, on May 31, 1991.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt;  Auto Shankar was [[hanging|hanged]] in Salem Central Prison.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt;

==Associates==

In 1992, Shankar's five accomplices were sentenced to six months of Rigorous Imprisonment after having been found guilty by a [[Magistrate]].&lt;ref name="RI"&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/05/05/stories/2002050501780400.htm The Hindu :  RI for jail wardens in 'Auto' Shankar case]&lt;/ref&gt; The accomplices were Shankar's brother, Mohan, Selva (alias Selvaraj) and the jail wardens Kannan, Balan and Rahim Khan.&lt;ref name="RI" /&gt; They were found guilty of ''criminal conspiracy'' and ''resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension''.&lt;ref name="RI" /&gt;

Subsequently, Mohan was also found guilty of the six murders and was given three [[life sentence]]s.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt; Mohan had escaped from the [[Chennai Central Prison]] in August 1990 and was captured in [[Pune]] on June 25, 1992.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt;

==Responses==
[[K. Vijay Kumar]], the Tamil Nadu Additional Director-General of Police, claimed that cinema was solely responsible for making  Shankar a criminal.&lt;ref name="Vijay"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/05/stories/2007030503780300.htm The Hindu : Media, police should not harm society's interests]&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned this during a seminar on "Crime and Media" in [[Kerala]].

The trial has become widely known across the nation since the Supreme Court invoked the American [[free speech]] doctrine and the case became oft-quoted in relation to journalistic [[investigative journalism|exposés]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2003/12/12/stories/2003121201851200.htm The Hindu : Whistles, stings and slapps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2001/09/07/stories/05072523.htm The Hindu : Tehelka: what next?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/10/15/stories/2004101500821000.htm The Hindu : The Tehelka Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular Culture==
The 1990 [[Tamil language]] film ''[[Pulan Visaranai]]'' directed by [[R. K. Selvamani]] was partially inspired by Auto Shankar's crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbthots.com/reviews/rewind/pvisaaranai.html&lt;/ref&gt; A television series based on his life was aired on Makkal TV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/The-Radha-MGR-episode/article15386008.ece&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Crime Patrol (TV series)|Crime Patrol]] aired an episode on Sony TV based on the story of Auto Shankar in February 2018. A 2019 Tamil web series produced by [[ZEE5]] is also based on him.&lt;ref name="statesman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thestatesman.com/entertainment/auto-shankar-zee5-web-series-serial-killer-gowri-shankar-premiers-23-april-1502743465.html |title=Auto Shankar: ZEE5 web series on serial killer Gowri Shankar premiers on 23 April |date=6 April 2019 |work=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] |access-date=7 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Samsonova was born on April 25, 1947, in the city of Uzhur, now part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai.&lt;ref name=of/&gt;

After graduating from high school, she arrived in Moscow and entered the [[Moscow State Linguistic University]]. After graduating, she moved to [[St. Petersburg]], where she married Alexei Samsonov. In 1971, she and her husband settled in the newly built panel house number 4 on Dimitrov Street.&lt;ref name=of/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.mk.ru/incident/2015/07/30/potroshitelnica-mitrofanovna-sosedi-rasskazali-o-zhizni-manyachki-iz-pitera.html|title=Aunt Toma's hut|author=Svetlana Samodelova|publisher=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]|date=31 July 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716063327/http://www.mk.ru/incident/2015/07/30/potroshitelnica-mitrofanovna-sosedi-rasskazali-o-zhizni-manyachki-iz-pitera.html|archive-date=16 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time she worked for [[Intourist]] travel agency, in particular, in the [[Grand Hotel Europe]]. The amount of work experience Samsonova gathered at the time of her retirement was 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://lifenews.ru/news/158336|title=The Granny Ripper was educated at an elite university in Moscow|author=Alexey Kobylkin|publisher=[[Life (news agency, Russia)|Life]]|date=28 August 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316140100/http://lifenews.ru/news/158336|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Samsonova's husband disappeared (she supposedly killed him and got rid of the body). She appealed to the police, but subsequent searches yielded nothing. Fifteen years later, in April 2015, she turned towards the authorities again, this time to the investigative unit of the Fruzensky District in St. Petersburg, giving a statement about her spouse's disappearance.&lt;ref name=ya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/08/05/suspected-serial-killing-granny-may-have-eaten-parts-of-her-victims |title=Suspected serial killing granny may have eaten parts of her victims &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; Ne |publisher=Torontosun.com |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2015-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805200851/http://www.torontosun.com/2015/08/05/suspected-serial-killing-granny-may-have-eaten-parts-of-her-victims |archive-date=2015-08-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
After her husband's disappearance, Samsonova began renting out a room in her apartment. According to investigators, on September 6, 2003, during a quarrel, she killed her tenant. He was a 44-year-old resident from [[Norilsk]]. She then dismembered his corpse and disposed of it on the street.&lt;ref name=taa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ya/&gt;&lt;ref name=wo&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/456754|title=Investigators in St. Petersburg asked not to rush to assign a series of murders to the pensioner|publisher=[[Interfax]]|date=29 July 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525181713/http://www.interfax.ru/russia/456754|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015 Samsonova met 79-year-old Valentina Nikolaevna Ulanova who also lived on Dimitrov Street. A friend of the two asked Ulanova to shelter Samsonova for a time due to the fact that Samsonova's apartment was being renovated, to which Ulanova agreed. Samsonova lived in Ulanova's apartment for several months, helping with the housework. She began to like living in the apartment, wanting to stay there for longer and refusing to move out. Over time the relationship between the two deteriorated, and Ulanova eventually asked Samsonova to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://lifenews.ru/news/160971|title=The Granny Ripper showed how she dismembered her friend|publisher=Life|date=7 September 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316195909/http://lifenews.ru/news/160971|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After another conflict, she decided to poison Ulanova. Samsonova travelled to [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg|Pushkin]], where she managed to persuade a pharmacist to sell her a prescription drug, [[phenazepam]]. Upon returning to the city, she bought an [[Olivier salad]], one of Ulanova's favorite dishes, then put the pills in the salad and gave it to the unsuspecting woman.&lt;ref name=po&gt;Supposedly she had eaten body parts of her victims but if hasn't been proven yet. {{Citeweb|url=http://lifenews.ru/news/160971|title=The Granny Ripper showed how she dismembered her friend|publisher=Life|date=7 September 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316195909/http://lifenews.ru/news/160971|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsonava later found Ulanova's body lying on the kitchen floor on the night of July 23 and proceeded to dismember it with  two knives and a saw. Firstly sawing off the victims head, she then sawed the body in half and then using the knives, she sheared it into pieces.&lt;ref name=wo/&gt; To take out all the bags outside of the apartment, she had to go outside and return several times. Samsonova left other parts of the body scattered around the house.&lt;ref name=ya/&gt;&lt;ref name=po/&gt;

On the evening of July 26, Ulanova's decapitated body with severed limbs, wrapped in a bathroom curtain,&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; was found near a pond located house number 10 on Dimitrov Street. The package initially didn't attract any attention for several days, until a local resident took an interest in its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/07/26/086/|title=A decapitated body with severed limbs was found on Dimitrov Street|publisher=Fontanka.ru|date=26 July 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412080537/http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/07/26/086/|archive-date=12 April 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the deceased was established on July 27, after a survey of apartment residents. When they knocked on Ulanova's apartment, Samsonova opened the door to the authorities. Having entered inside, police officers found traces of blood in the bathroom, and also fastening from the torn off curtain. After this, the pensioner was immediately arrested.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt;&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/elderly-russian-woman-suspected-of-multiple-macabre-murders-dismemberments/526443.html |title=Elderly Russian Woman Suspected of Multiple Macabre Murders, Dismemberments &amp;#124; News |newspaper=The Moscow Times |date=2015-07-29 |accessdate=2015-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802023713/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/elderly-russian-woman-suspected-of-multiple-macabre-murders-dismemberments/526443.html |archive-date=2015-08-02 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=f&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://ria.ru/incidents/20150729/1152967122.html|title=A St. Petersburg court arrested a pensioner suspected of cruel murder|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=29 July 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223053912/http://ria.ru/incidents/20150729/1152967122.html|archive-date=23 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation and compulsory treatment===
On July 29, 2015, Samsonova was brought to the Frunze District Court of St. Petersburg, with the court issuing an order to detain her.&lt;ref name=f/&gt;

She was forced to take a forensic psychiatric exam, and on November 26, 2015, the results determined that she was a danger to society and herself, and therefore she was placed in a specialized institution until the end of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/2474053|title=A retired woman, to whom the media has attributed more than 10 murders, was placed in a psychiatric hospital|publisher=[[TASS]]|date=26 November 2015|language=Russian|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215123144/https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/2474053|archive-date=15 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is being investigated in connection to a total of 14 murders.&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;

According to media reports, police found a diary which contained details of some of the murders. One entry, translated from Russian to English, read: “I killed my tenant Volodya, cut him to pieces in the bathroom with a knife and put the pieces of his body in plastic bags and threw them away in the different parts of [[Frunzensky District, Saint Petersburg|Frunzensky District]].”&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

'''Anatoly Yemelianovich Slivko''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Анатолий Емельянович Сливко; December 28, 1938 – September 16, 1989) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[serial killer]], convicted of killing seven teenage boys in and around [[Nevinnomyssk]], [[Stavropol Krai]], [[Russian SFSR]], between 1964 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a two decade-long period, Slivko [[molested]] young boys at his youth club after tricking them into [[unconsciousness]], killing some of them in an attempt to recreate the violent death of a teenage boy he had witnessed in 1961, which had [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] him.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Slivko was [[Capital punishment in the Soviet Union|executed]] by [[Execution by shooting#Soviet Bloc|shooting]] on 16 September 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' pp. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Anatoly Yemelianovich Slivko was born on 28 December 1938 in [[Izerbash]], [[Dagestan ASSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. He lived in [[Stavropol]] and was a married father of two children, although he had known himself to be [[homosexual]] since puberty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Slivko witnessed a traffic accident in which a drunken motorcyclist had swerved into a group of pedestrians, fatally injuring a boy in his early teens who was wearing a [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] uniform.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons Slivko would later insist he never could explain, this scene had [[sexual arousal|sexually excited]] him. He later recalled the accident vividly: "The boy had experienced [[convulsion]]s in his death throes as the smell of gasoline and fire permeated the air."&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1963, Slivko exploited his position at a children's club he ran to relive the fantasies of this accident.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Once or twice a year, he would form a close friendship with a boy who was usually aged between 12 and 15 and never older than 17.{{refn|group=n|Following his arrest, Slivko stated to investigators he never selected a youth older than 17 both because the boy killed in the 1961 traffic accident which had sparked his fantasies had been in his early teens, and out of concerns regarding the victim's physical strength.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}} The boy would be short for his age and would be wearing a Young Pioneers uniform - just like the boy Slivko had seen die in the traffic accident. Slivko would gain the boy's confidence and tell him of an experiment he knew which involved a controlled [[hanging]] to stretch the [[Vertebral column|spine]], and that he would reenact the scene of a [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] executed by Nazi soldiers for his children's club in order to film this scene,&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; after which, the boy was assured, Slivko would revive him from his state of [[unconsciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to each boy undertaking this "experiment", Slivko would purchase a new uniform for the victim to wear and shine his shoes. In addition, to prevent any vomiting, the victim was required not to eat for several hours before the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qX0gAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Born+to+Kill+in+the+USSR&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIwq-XvcDtyAIVgi4aCh1mFA6o#v=onepage&amp;q=slivko&amp;f=false p. 67]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the boy was unconscious, Slivko would strip him naked, caress and fondle him, take films in which he would arrange the body in suggestive positions, and repeatedly [[masturbate]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
Over the course of 22 years, Slivko persuaded 43 boys to take part in this contrived experiment. In 36 cases, following his established ritual of [[photography]], filming, and repeated masturbation, Slivko revived these boys. Cautioned by Slivko into silence, these individuals resumed their lives unaware of what had happened to them whilst they had been unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; However, in seven cases, Slivko's behavior became violent: once these victims were unconscious, he [[dismembered]] their bodies, poured [[gasoline]] on their limbs and torso, and set the remains on fire to remind himself of the traffic accident which had sparked his arousal. Slivko typically retained the victim's shoes as a [[Souvenir|memento]], as well as the photographs and films which he developed in a home laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures and films served as stimuli for Slivko's masturbatory fantasies for months or years until he needed fresher stimuli and killed again.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting the Devil'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 1964, Slivko killed his first victim, a 15-year-old runaway boy named Nikolai Dobryshev.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Slivko claimed this particular victim was killed unintentionally, as he had been unable to revive Dobryshev once he was unconscious. He dismembered the boy's body and [[Burial|buried]] him, also destroying the film and photographs he had taken of this particular victim. In May 1965, Slivko killed his second victim, Aleksei Kovalenko. Slivko began operating a tourist club for boys named Chergid in 1966, after his first club had been destroyed in a fire.

Eight years later, on November 14, 1973, a 15-year-old boy named Aleksander Nesmeyanov disappeared in [[Nevinnomyssk]], [[Stavropol Krai]]. Two years later, on May 11, 1975, an 11-year-old boy named Andrei Pogasyan disappeared. Pogasyan's mother told the police that a man had shot a film in a nearby forest and that her son was going to participate. However, the police did nothing to prevent this because they knew Slivko, who had won awards for other, more innocuous films. In 1980, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Fatsiyev, who along with Nesmeyanov and Pogasyan was a member of Chergid, disappeared. The next victim was a fifteen-year-old named Vyacheslav Khovistik, who was killed in 1982. On July 23, 1985, Slivko killed his final victim, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Pavlov, who disappeared after telling a neighbor he was going to meet the leader of Chergid.

== Arrest ==
In November 1985, [[prosecutor]] Tamara Languyeva investigated Pavlov's disappearance and took an interest in Chergid's activities. However, she had no evidence of anything illegal in the way the club was run. Languyeva questioned many boys who had belonged to the club, who said they had suffered "temporary [[amnesia]]" and that Slivko had performed many experiments with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5937/fi26843&lt;/ref&gt; Following a long inquiry, Slivko was arrested at his [[Stavropol]] home in December 1985. He would later be formally accused of seven murders, seven counts of [[sexual abuse]], and seven counts of [[necrophilia]]. In early 1986, he led investigators to the bodies of six of his victims, although he was unable to locate the body of his first victim, Nikolai Dobryshev. In June 1986, he was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] and placed on [[death row]] in [[Novocherkassk]] prison.

In 1989, Slivko was asked by the police to help arrest a then-unidentified serial killer of [[Rostov Oblast]] who had killed a minimum of 29 victims by the time he was approached.&lt;ref&gt;''The Worst People in History'' p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Although Slivko did provide some insight into how offenders such as himself were able to function, much of the actual advice he provided to police would prove to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; The then-unidentified serial killer, [[Andrei Chikatilo]], was arrested in 1990 and would be convicted of killing 52 women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19921015&amp;id=rrE0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4816,1957003&amp;hl=en/|title=Soviet serial killer is sentenced to life term|publisher=The Prescott Courier|date=15 October 1992|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Execution ==
On September 16, 1989, just hours after he was interviewed by the police, Slivko was [[death penalty|executed]] by [[execution by shooting|shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stoneman''' is a name given by the popular English-language print media of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[India]] to an unidentified [[serial killer]] who murdered at least 13 homeless people of that city during their sleep in 1989. The name is also given to the perpetrator of a similar series of murders in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] from 1985 to 1988. It has been speculated that these were the work of the same person, who could have been responsible for as many as 26 murders.

The Stoneman was blamed for thirteen murders over six months (the first in June 1989), but it was never established whether the crimes were committed by one person or a group of individuals. The [[Kolkata Police Force|Calcutta Police]] also failed to resolve whether any of the crimes were committed as a [[copycat crimes|copycat murder]]. To date, no one has been charged with any of the crimes; all thirteen cases remain unsolved.

==Bombay killings==
The first hint of a [[serial-killer]] who was targeting homeless ragpickers and beggars in India came from [[Bombay]]. Starting in 1985, and lasting well over two years, a series of twelve murders were committed in the [[Sion, India|Sion]] and [[King's Circle]] locality of the city. The criminal or criminals' ''modus operandi'' was simple: first they would find an unsuspecting victim sleeping alone in a desolate area. The victim's head was crushed with a single stone weighing as much as 30&amp;nbsp;kg (~66 lbs). In most cases, the victims' identities could not be ascertained since they slept alone and did not have relatives or associates who could identify them. Compounded to this was the fact that the victims were people of very simple means and the individual crimes were not high-profile. It was after the sixth murder that the [[Bombay Police]] began to see a pattern in the crimes.

A stroke of luck seemed to come the police's way when a homeless waiter survived a brutal attack and managed to escape being bludgeoned to death. However, in the dimly lit area of Sion where he was sleeping, he had not been able to get a good look at his assailant, and what seemed like a big break came to naught.

Shortly afterwards, in 1987, a [[ragpicker]] was hacked to death in the adjoining suburb of [[Matunga]]. Even though the police and the media were quick to label this the handiwork of the same person, no evidence to link this crime with the others was ever found.

As mysteriously as the killings had started, by the middle of 1988, they stopped. To this date the case is unsolved.

==Summer of 1989 in Calcutta==
Whether or not the Bombay killings were linked to the Calcutta "Stoneman" killings has never been confirmed. However, the uncanny similarity in the instrument, choice of victims, execution, and the time of the attacks suggests the assailant(s) was familiar with the Bombay episodes, if not the same killer himself.

The first victim in Calcutta died from injuries to the head in June 1989. Twelve more would die in the next six months as panic gripped the city. All of the murdered were homeless pavement-dwellers who slept alone in dimly lit areas of the city. Most of the murders took place in central Calcutta, adjoining the [[Howrah Bridge]].&lt;ref name="ghoshhtimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Ritujay |title=The elusive stoneman of Kolkata |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/the-elusive-stoneman-of-kolkata/story-BQBcCHfk87WvoLp2LSCKRN.html |website=HinduSan Stimes.com |publisher=Ritujay Ghosh |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the murderer killed victims by dropping a heavy stone or concrete slab, the police assumed that the assailant was probably a tall, well-built male. However, in the complete absence of any eyewitnesses or survivors, no clear-cut leads were available.

Massive deployments of police in various parts of the city at night were resorted to, and numerous arrests were made. After a spell of arrests in which a handful of "suspicious persons" were rounded up for questioning, the killings stopped. However, since there was no incriminating evidence, all those summarily arrested had to be released. To date, the crimes remain unsolved.

==Stoneman in Guwahati==
Similar incidents were reported in [[Guwahati]] city of [[Assam]] state during February 2009.

==Film adaptations based upon the events==
Producer [[Bobby Bedi]] produced a film titled ''[[The Stoneman Murders]]'' based on these incidents. The film released on 13 February 2009, starring [[Kay Kay Menon]] and [[Arbaaz Khan]], and written and directed by [[Manish Gupta (director)|Manish Gupta]]. Gupta said that his story for the movie is 40% fact and 60% fiction. The movie depicts the killings to be a part of a religious ritual being conducted by a policeman, with the actual perpetrator left open to interpretation at the end.

In 2011, a Bengali film named ''[[Baishe Srabon]]'' released which was directed by Srijit Mukherjee. The plot of the movie revolved around the same mysterious serial killings in Kolkata, which took place during the period of 1989. In the movie, the assassin is shown to brutally murder and the victims mostly belonged to the ignoble and the plebeian league of the society; either prostitutes, anti-socials or street dwellers. However, the climax of the movie saw the serial killer shooting himself after confessing all his crudities, which, in fact, is a clear deviation from the actual incident.

'''Peter William Sutcliffe''' (born 2 June 1946), also known as '''Peter William Coonan''', is a prolific English [[serial killer]] who was dubbed the ’'''Yorkshire Ripper'''’ by the press. On 22 May 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]], which was increased to a [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales#Whole life order|whole life order]] in 2010. All except two of his murders took place in [[West Yorkshire]]; the others were in [[Manchester]].

Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appeared to have moved to [[red light district]]s because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Yorkshire Ripper Files:A Very British Crime Story, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date= 27 March 2019 |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/crime/the-yorkshire-ripper-files-why-chapeltown-in-leeds-was-the-hunting-ground-of-peter-sutcliffe-1-9673863|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Files: Why Chapeltown in Leeds was the 'hunting ground' of Peter Sutcliffe|accessdate=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]].

He confessed to being the perpetrator, saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. At his trial, Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]], but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name of Coonan.

West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation. Because of the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including the [[Wearside Jack]] hoax recorded message and letters purporting to be from the "Ripper"). Following Sutcliffe's conviction, the government ordered a review of the investigation, conducted by [[Lawrence Byford]], known as the "Byford Report". The findings were made fully public in 2006 and confirmed the validity of the criticism against the force. The report led to changes to investigative procedures which were adopted across UK police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-43030591|title=Sir Lawrence Byford: Yorkshire Ripper report author dies|website=[[BBC News]]|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the manhunt as "stunningly mishandled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/27/the-yorkshire-ripper-files-a-very-british-crime-story-review-a-stunningly-mismanaged-manhunt|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Files review – a stunningly mishandled manhunt|website=[[The Guardian]]|first=Tim|last=Dowling|date=27 March 2019|accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe was transferred from prison to a [[Broadmoor Hospital|high-security psychiatric hospital]] in March 1984 after being diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12027015/Yorkshire-Ripper-Peter-Sutcliffe-was-never-mentally-ill-claims-detective-who-hunted-him.html|title=Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe 'was never mentally ill' claims detective who hunted him|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=16 October 2019|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and he was transferred that month to [[HM Prison Frankland]] in [[County Durham|Durham]].

==Early life==
Sutcliffe was born in [[Bingley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to a [[working-class]] family. He was given a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] upbringing by his parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yallop|first=David|title=Deliver us from Evil|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H7_QBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210|year=2014|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-47211-658-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (née Coonan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|title=A Killer's Mask|work=trutv.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|archivedate=21 March 2009|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a [[gravedigger]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Stephen|title=Who is the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe?

After leaving Baird Television, Sutcliffe worked nightshifts at the Britannia Works of Anderton International from April 1973. In February 1975, he took [[Voluntary Redundancy|redundancy]] and used half of the £400 pay-off to train as a [[Large Goods Vehicle|heavy goods vehicle (HGV)]] driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gordon |last=Burn |authorlink=Gordon Burn |year=1993 |title=Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son: The Story of Peter Sutcliffe |publisher=Mandarin |isbn=978-0-7493-1331-9 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 1976, he was dismissed for the theft of used tyres.

Sutcliffe, by some reports, used prostitutes as a young man, and it has been speculated that he had a bad experience, during which he was conned out of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm "Peter Sutcliffe: The Yorkshire Ripper – Famous Criminal"], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620054640/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm |date=20 June 2008 }} ''Crime And Investigation Network''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}} Other analyses of his actions have not found evidence that he actually sought their services, although he clearly expressed unusual behaviour{{clarify|reason=Expressed? + What behaviour?|date=June 2018}} before the killings.&lt;ref name=grisly/&gt;

Sutcliffe met [[Sonia Sutcliffe|Sonia Szurma]] on [[St Valentine's Day|14 February]] 1967; they married on 10 August 1974. She suffered several miscarriages and they were informed that she would not be able to have children. She resumed a teacher training course, during which time she had an affair with an ice-cream van driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial03.htm|title=THE TRIAL: WEEK ONE|website=www.execulink.com|access-date=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she completed the course in 1977 and began teaching, she and Sutcliffe used her salary to buy a house in [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]], [[Bradford]], into which they moved on 26 September 1977, and where they were living at the time of Sutcliffe's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html "Peter Sutcliffe" "A Killer's Mask"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html |date=21 March 2009 }}, by Fiona Steel for Trutv.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his childhood and his early adolescence, Sutcliffe showed no signs of abnormality. Later, in part related to his occupation as a gravedigger, he developed a macabre sense of humour. In his late adolescence, he developed a growing obsession with voyeurism and spent much time spying on prostitutes and the men seeking their services.&lt;ref name=grisly&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Serial Killer Investigations: The Grisly Business Unit|author1=Robert D.

==Attacks and murders==

===1969===
Sutcliffe assaulted a prostitute he had met while searching for a woman who had tricked him out of money. He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running. He told Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it".&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim01.htm |title=Stone-in-sock attack |publisher=Execulink.com |date=29 September 1969 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police visited his home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's [[vehicle registration plate]]. Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand. The police told him he was "very lucky", as the woman did not want anything more to do with the incident – she was a known prostitute, and her husband was serving a jail term for assault.&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;

===1975===
Sutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in [[Keighley]]. He attacked Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a [[ball-peen hammer]] and slashing her stomach with a knife. Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her. Rogulskyj survived after extensive medical intervention but was [[Psychological trauma|psychologically traumatised]] by the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html TruTV.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001184952/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html |date=1 October 2012 }} Fiona Steel; retrieved 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked Olive Smelt in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in August. Employing the same ''[[modus operandi]]'', he struck her from behind and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered from emotional and mental health problems, including [[clinical depression]]. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in [[Silsden]]. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off when he saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Yallop|Yallop, David]].

The first victim to lose her life in a Sutcliffe attack was Wilma McCann on 30 October. McCann, from [[Scott Hall, Leeds|Scott Hall]] in [[Leeds]], was a mother of four. Sutcliffe struck her twice with a hammer before stabbing her 15 times in the neck, chest and abdomen. An extensive inquiry, involving 150 police officers and 11,000 interviews, failed to find the culprit. One of McCann's daughters died by suicide in December 2007, reportedly after suffering years of depression over her mother's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton, Allegra.

===1976===
Sutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds in January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Jackson 52 times. In dire financial straits, Jackson had been using the family van to exchange sexual favours for money. Sutcliffe picked up Jackson who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, he then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm|title=THE ATTACKS AND MURDERS – EMILY JACKSON|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, and then dragged her body into a rubbish strewn yard and used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen. Sutcliffe stomped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm |title=Emily Jackson |publisher=Execulink.com |date=20 January 1976 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in [[Roundhay Park]], Leeds, on 9 May. Walking home from a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out of the car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1977===
On 5 February Sutcliffe attacked Irene Richardson, a [[Chapeltown, Leeds|Chapeltown]] sex worker, in Roundhay Park. Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Once she was dead, he mutilated her corpse with a knife. Tyre&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in this sentence --&gt; tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0586-05526-7}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, on 23 April, Sutcliffe killed Patricia "Tina" Atkinson, a sex worker from Bradford, in her flat, where police found a bootprint on the bedclothes. Two months later on 26 June, he murdered 16-year-old Jayne MacDonald in Chapeltown. She was not a sex worker and, in the public perception, showed that all women were potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim11.htm |title=Jayne MacDonald |publisher=Execulink.com |date=26 June 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe seriously assaulted Maureen Long in Bradford in July. He was interrupted and left her for dead. A witness misidentified the make of his car. More than 300 police officers collected 12,500 statements and checked thousands of cars, without success. On 1 October 1977 Sutcliffe murdered Jean Jordan, a sex worker from [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cross| first = Roger| title = Yorkshire Ripper| year = 1981| publisher = HarperCollins UK| isbn = 978-0-586-05526-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/92 92]| url = https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a confession, Sutcliffe said he had realised the new £5 note he had given her was traceable. After hosting a family party at his new home, he returned to the wasteland behind Manchester's [[Southern Cemetery, Manchester|Southern Cemetery]], where he had left the body, to retrieve the note. Unable to find it, he mutilated Jordan's corpse and moved it.&lt;ref name="execulink.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim13.htm |title=Jean Jordan |publisher=Execulink.com |date=1 October 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October, Jordan's body was discovered by local dairy worker and future actor [[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bruce-jones-les-battersby-actor-2013816 |title = Bruce Jones: Les Battersby actor reveals depression drove him to try to kill himself and his wife|date = 30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had an allotment on land adjoining the site where the body was found and was searching for house bricks when he made the discovery. The £5 note, hidden in a secret compartment in Jordan's handbag, was traced to branches of the [[Midland Bank]] in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Bingley]]. Police analysis of bank operations allowed them to narrow their field of inquiry to 8,000 employees who could have received it in their wage packet. Over three months the police interviewed 5,000 men, including Sutcliffe. The police found that the alibi given for Sutcliffe's whereabouts was credible; he had indeed spent much of the evening of the killing at a family party. Weeks of intense investigations pertaining to the origins of the £5 note led to nothing, leaving police officers frustrated that they collected an important clue, but had been unable to trace the actual firm (or employee within the firm) to which the note had been issued.&lt;ref name=shook&gt;"The Yorkshire Ripper". ''Crimes That Shook Britain'': Season 4, Episode 4. (6 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, Sutcliffe attacked Marilyn Moore, another sex worker from Leeds. She survived and provided police with a description of her attacker.&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in following sentence --&gt; Tyre tracks found at the scene matched those from an earlier attack.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1978===
The police discontinued the search for the person who received the £5 note in January 1978. Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about it, he was not investigated further (he was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions). That month, Sutcliffe killed again. His victim was Yvonne Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford. He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-peen hammer then jumped on her chest before stuffing horse-hair into her mouth from a discarded sofa under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was not found until 26 March.

Ten days later, he killed Helen Rytka, an 18-year-old sex worker from [[Huddersfield]]. He struck Rytka on the head five times as she exited his vehicle, before stripping most of the clothes from her body (although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found three days later beneath railway arches in Garrards timber-yard to which he had driven her.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, Sutcliffe killed Vera Millward in an attack in the car park of [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim17.htm |title=website |publisher=Execulink.com |date=16 May 1978 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979===
On 4 April 1979, Sutcliffe killed Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old building society clerk whom he attacked on Savile Park Moor in Halifax as she was walking home. Despite forensic evidence, police efforts were diverted for several months following receipt of a taped message purporting to be from the murderer taunting Assistant Chief Constable [[George Oldfield (detective)|George Oldfield]], who was leading the investigation. The tape contained a man's voice saying "I'm Jack. I see you're having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord, you're no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started."&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes'' by Martin Fido&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the recorded message, police began searching for a man with a [[Wearside]] accent, which linguists narrowed down to the [[Castletown, Tyne and Wear|Castletown]] area of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The hoaxer, dubbed "[[Wearside Jack]]", sent two letters to police and ''The Daily Mirror'' in March 1978 boasting of his crimes. The letters, signed "[[Jack the Ripper]]", claimed responsibility for the murder of 26-year-old Joan Harrison in [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in November 1975. At the time, police mistakenly believed that the Preston murder was not public knowledge.
The hoaxer case was re-opened in 2005, and DNA taken from envelopes was entered into the national database. On 20 October 2005, John Samuel Humble, an unemployed alcoholic and long-time resident of the [[Ford Estate]] in Sunderland – a few miles from Castletown – was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice for sending the hoax letters and tape. Humble, whose DNA had been taken following a drunk and disorderly offence in 2001, was remanded in custody and on 21 March 2006 was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Ian|title=Wearside Jack: I deserve to go to jail for 'evil' Ripper hoax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wearside-jack-i-deserve-to-go-to-jail-for-evil-ripper-hoax-6106028.html|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humble died on 30 July 2019, aged 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-49406231 |title=Yorkshire Ripper hoaxer Wearside Jack dies |publisher=BBC |date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Leach, a [[University of Bradford|Bradford University]] student. Her body was dumped at the rear of 13 Ashgrove under a pile of bricks, close to the university and her lodgings. It was his 16th attack. The murder of a woman who was not a sex worker again alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the £5 note, he was not strongly suspected. Sutcliffe was interviewed by police nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/intervws.htm |title=Vera Millward |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980===
In April 1980 Sutcliffe was arrested for drunk driving. While awaiting trial, he killed two more women. He murdered 47-year-old Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August, and 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill, a student at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]], on the night of 17 November. Hill's body was found in the grounds of the Lupton Residences. He attacked three other women who survived; Uphadya Bandara in Leeds on 24 September, Maureen Lea (known as Mo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/05/mo-lea-artist-yorkshire-ripper-peter-sutcliffe|title='I've turned the tables on Peter Sutcliffe': artist Mo Lea on why she finally drew her attacker|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art student attacked in the grounds of Leeds University on 25 October and 16-year-old Theresa Sykes, attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5 November. On 25 November Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe, reported him to the police as a suspect but the information vanished into the paperwork already accumulated.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:Milgarth Police Station, Leeds.jpg|thumb|right|Millgarth Police Station in [[Leeds city centre]], now demolished, where the Yorkshire Ripper police investigation was conducted.]]

On 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the driveway of Light Trades House in Melbourne Avenue, [[Broomhill (ward)|Broomhill]], [[Sheffield]]. A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed his car had false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested and transferred to [[Dewsbury]] Police Station. At Dewsbury he was questioned in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. The next day police returned to the scene of the arrest and discovered a knife, hammer and rope he had discarded when he briefly slipped away from the police after telling them he was "bursting for a pee". Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. The police obtained a [[search warrant]] for his home at 6 Garden Lane in Heaton, Bradford and brought his wife in for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/arrest.htm |title=Arrest and confession |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sutcliffe was stripped at the police station he was wearing an inverted V-neck sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 publication of the book, ''Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper'', by Michael Bilton. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when talking of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, he vehemently denied responsibility. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the "Wearside Jack" claim, and in 2011, [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] demonstrated the crime had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who had died in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA helps police 'solve' 1975 Joan Harrison murder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-12396506|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe was charged on 5 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/confessn.htm |title=Statement |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial, he pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]]. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe said he had heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from the headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial04.htm "The Trial: Week Two"], Trial of Peter Sutcliffe&lt;/ref&gt; and that the voices were that of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2833589.stm "MP's Ripper prison demand"], ''BBC World News''. 9 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527001131/http://www.crimeandjustice.us/forums/lofiversion/index.php?t6951.html "Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe's Weight-Gain Strategy in Latest Bid for Freedom"], ''New Criminologist''. 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He pleaded guilty to seven charges of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe's plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] but the trial judge, Justice Sir [[Leslie Boreham]], demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] [[Michael Havers|Sir Michael Havers]], a 90-minute lunch break and another 40&amp;nbsp;minutes of legal discussion, the judge rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial01.htm Execulink.com website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial03.htm |title=Trial: week 1 |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted two weeks and despite the efforts of his counsel [[James Chadwin|James Chadwin QC]], Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_2504000/2504409.stm "1981: Yorkshire Ripper jailed for life"] BBC On This Day, 22 May&lt;/ref&gt; The jury rejected the evidence of four psychiatrists that Sutcliffe had paranoid schizophrenia, possibly influenced by the evidence of a prison officer who heard him say to his wife that if he convinced people he was mad then he might get ten years in a "loony bin".&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge said Sutcliffe was beyond redemption, and hoped he would never leave prison. He recommended a minimum term of 30 years to be served before parole could be considered meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16 July 2010, the [[High Court]] issued Sutcliffe with a [[whole life tariff]], meaning he is unlikely ever to be released. The whole life tariff was introduced by the government in 1983, and over the next 20 years it was reported that Sutcliffe was among the small group of prisoners to have been issued with a whole life tariff. Politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners in November 2002, and the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner can serve has since rested with the High Court.

After his trial, Sutcliffe admitted two other attacks. It was decided that prosecution for these offences was "not in the public interest". [[West Yorkshire Police]] made it clear that the victims wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/otherv.htm |title=OTHER YORKSHIRE RIPPER VICTIMS?|publisher=Execulink.com |accessdate= 25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of West Yorkshire Police==
West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1982-01-19/debates/f9d9628e-7756-4e42-b6ed-877b25bea741/LordsChamber |title=The Yorkshire Ripper Case |last=Ganzoni |first=John |authorlink=John Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead |date=19 January 1982 |website=House of Lords Hansard |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=2 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34615802|title=One Girl's Life in the Ripper Years|accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=BBC|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. The 1982 Byford report into the investigation concluded 'The ineffectiveness of the major incident room was a serious handicap to the Ripper investigation. While it should have been the effective nerve centre of the whole police operation, the backlog of unprocessed information resulted in the failure to connect vital pieces of related information. This serious fault in the central index system allowed Peter Sutcliffe to continually slip through the net'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/byfdsamp.htm|title=BYFORD AND SAMPSON REPORTS|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/15/story-of-yorkshire-ripper-hoaxer-wearside-jack-to-be-made-into-movie|title=Story of Yorkshire Ripper Hoaxer 'Wearside Jack' to be Made into Movie |accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the [[FBI]], plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis,&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that "Wearside Jack" was a blatant hoaxer.{{refn|group=n|George Oldfield and other senior individuals involved in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper had consulted senior [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]]s [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] and [[Robert Ressler]] in an effort to construct a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the Yorkshire Ripper in 1979. After playing the hoax tape to Ressler and Douglas, Ressler said to Oldfield: "You do realise, of course, that the man on the tape is not the killer, don't you?" Oldfield chose to ignore this observation.&lt;ref&gt;Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp. 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;}} The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The "Wearside Jack" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the [[Home Office Large Major Enquiry System]], the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In response to the police reaction to the murders, the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] organised a number of '[[Reclaim the Night]]' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire]]''.  The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that the [[Chief Constable]] of West Yorkshire did not owe a [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the [[Caparo test|''Caparo'' test]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050421/brooks-1.htm "Judgments – Brooks (FC) (Respondent) v.

==Byford Report==
The [[Inspector of Constabulary]] Sir Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006. The sections  "Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's "immediate associates" were not disclosed by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/mistakes-that-left-ripper-on-the-loose-1-2372470|title= Mistakes that left Ripper on the loose|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of the murder of Wilma McCann, the report states: "There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities" and "it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country".&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Rob|last2=Campbell|first2=Duncan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/02/freedomofinformation.ukcrime|title=Ripper guilty of additional crimes, says secret report|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an "otherwise unremarkable young man", came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/ripper-may-have-attacked-more/2006/06/02/1148956547934.html|title=Ripper may have attacked more|work=Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Reuters|date=3 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norfolk|first=Andrew|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article2461911.ece|title=Peter Sutcliffe, the bullied mummy's boy who gave millions nightmares|work=The Times|location=London|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also arrested in Bradford's [[red light district]] for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with "going equipped for stealing" as it was assumed he was a potential burglar.&lt;ref name="home office"&gt;"Sir Lawrence Byford report into the police handling of the Yorkshire Ripper case", ''Home Office''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; The report said that it was clear he had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford sex worker with a [[Club (weapon)|cosh]].&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Byford's report states:

{{quote|We feel it is highly improbable that the crimes in respect of which Sutcliffe has been charged and convicted are the only ones attributable to him. This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffe's overall modus operandi. I hasten to add that I feel sure that the senior police officers in the areas concerned are also mindful of this possibility but, in order to ensure full account is taken of all the information available, I have arranged for an effective liaison to take place.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

Police identified a number of attacks which matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes.

The Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Whitelaw]], the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation had been disclosed. Sir Lawrence described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe since 1966. On 25 November 1980, Birdsall sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows:

{{quote|I have good reason to {{sic|now}} the man you are looking for in the Ripper case. This man {{sic|as|nolink=yes}} dealings with prostitutes and always had a thing about them… His name and address is Peter Sutcliffe, {{sic|5|nolink=yes}} Garden Lane, Heaton, Bradford. {{sic|Clarkes|nolink=yes}} Trans. Shipley.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

This letter was marked "Priority No 1". An index card was created on the basis of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three existing index cards in the records. But "for some inexplicable reason", said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the incident room until the murderer's arrest on 2 January the following year.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;

Birdsall visited Bradford Police Station the day after sending the letter to repeat his misgivings about Sutcliffe. He added that he was with Sutcliffe when he got out of a car to pursue a woman with whom he had had a bar room dispute in Halifax on 16 August 1975. This was the date and place of the Olive Smelt attack. A report compiled on the visit was lost, despite a "comprehensive search" which took place after Sutcliffe's arrest, according to the report.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt; Byford said:

{{quote|The failure to take advantage of Birdsall's anonymous letter and his visit to the police station was yet again a stark illustration of the progressive decline in the overall efficiency of the major incident room. It resulted in Sutcliffe being at liberty for more than a month when he might conceivably have been in custody. Thankfully, there is no reason to think he committed any further murderous assaults within that period.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

==Custody==
===Prison and Broadmoor Hospital===
Following his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg==|title=74 Adjudication|work=News &amp; Features|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|date=29 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207144321/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg%3D%3D|archivedate=7 December 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his sentence at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|HMP Parkhurst]] on 22 May 1981. Despite being found sane at his trial, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked. While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence. On 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into the recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst Prison, and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring 30 stitches.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/attackps.htm "Attacks on Peter Sutcliffe"], ''The Yorkshire Ripper''.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1984 Sutcliffe was sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], under Section 47 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/peter-sutcliffe-yorkshire-ripper-moved-from-broadmoor-psychiatric-hospital-to-prison-a7210211.html|title=Yorkshire Ripper moved back to prison after 32 years in Broadmoor|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife obtained a separation from him in 1982 and a divorce in April 1994. On 23 February 1996, Sutcliffe was attacked in his room in Broadmoor Hospital's Henley Ward. Paul Wilson, a convicted robber, asked to borrow a videotape before attempting to strangle him with the cable from a pair of stereo headphones. Two other convicted murderers, [[Kenneth Erskine]] and Jamie Devitt, intervened on hearing screams.&lt;ref name="Brannen"/&gt;

After an attack with a pen by fellow inmate Ian Kay on 10 March 1997, Sutcliffe lost the vision in his left eye, and his right eye was severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|title= Crime Case Closed: Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127141209/http://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|archivedate=27 January 2007|work=BBC News|date=27 January 2007|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay admitted trying to kill Sutcliffe, and was ordered to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anon|title=Deranged killer admits Yorkshire Ripper blinding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/51090.stm|accessdate=6 January 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 it was reported that Sutcliffe had developed diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/archive/2003/08/30/Bradford+District+Archive/8010330.Ripper_Sutcliffe_has_diabetes/ "Ripper Sutcliffe has diabetes"], ''Craven Herald and Pioneer'', 30 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe's father died in 2004 and was cremated. On 17 January 2005 Sutcliffe was allowed to visit [[Grange-over-Sands]] where the ashes had been scattered. The decision to allow the temporary release was initiated by [[David Blunkett]] and ratified by [[Charles Clarke]] when he became Home Secretary. Sutcliffe was accompanied by four members of the hospital staff. Despite the passage of 25 years since the Ripper murders, Sutcliffe's visit was the focus of front-page tabloid headlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4190525.stm "Ripper visits father's ashes site"], ''BBC News Online''. 20 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, Sutcliffe was attacked by fellow inmate Patrick Sureda, who lunged at him with a metal cutlery knife while shouting "You fucking raping, murdering bastard, I'll blind your fucking other one". Sutcliffe flung himself backwards and the blade missed his right eye, stabbing him in the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/24/ukcrime1 "Yorkshire Ripper stabbed in face"], ''The Guardian'', 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2009, it was reported&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4684906/Yorkshire-Ripper-Peter-Sutcliffe-fit-to-be-freed-from-Broadmoor.html "Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe 'fit to be freed from Broadmoor'."] ''Daily Telegraph''. 17 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that Sutcliffe was "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Jack Straw]], was questioned by [[Julie Kirkbride]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Bromsgrove]], in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, "that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/8583782.stm|title='No release' for Yorkshire Ripper, says Jack Straw|work=BBC News|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 Sutcliffe told other prisoners one of his testicles was five times its normal size following treatment for a bladder infection. Subsequently a cancer scan was carried out with Sutcliffe then calling the [[National Health Service]] 'useless' for not giving him the results of his cancer scan immediately.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

On 26 August 2016 the police investigation was the subject of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Reunion (radio programme)|The Reunion]]''. [[Sue MacGregor]] discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who later became assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, who was a junior detective who interviewed Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, who worked in the incident room and interviewed suspects; David Zackrisson, who investigated the "Wearside Jack" tape and letters in Sunderland and [[Christa Ackroyd]], a local journalist in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pdd7r|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Investigation, The Reunion – BBC Radio 4|work=bbc.co.uk|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall&lt;!--This correct; it is NOT Paintball!--&gt; to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964. This inquiry also looked at the killings of two sex workers in southern Sweden in 1980. As Sutcliffe was a lorry driver, it was theorised that he had been in Denmark and Sweden, making use of the ferry across the [[Oresund Strait]]. West Yorkshire Police later stated that they were "absolutely certain" that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Joan|title=The Yorkshire Ripper was not a 'prostitute killer' – now his forgotten victims need justice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/yorkshire-ripper-not-prostitute-killer-forgotten-victims-need/|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Joanna Jolly | last = Jolly | first = Joanna | title = The Ripper and the Swedish murders | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_ripper_and_the_swedish_murders | accessdate = 13 January 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
''[[This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper]]'', a British [[television]] [[crime drama]] miniseries, first shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 26 January to 2 February 2000 is a dramatisation of the real-life investigation into the murders, showing the effect that it had on the health and career of Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield ([[Alun Armstrong]]). The series also starred [[Richard Ridings]] and [[James Laurenson]] as DSI Dick Holland and Chief Constable Ronald Gregory, respectively. Although broadcast over two weeks, two episodes were shown consecutively each week. The series was nominated for the [[BAFTA|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Drama Serial at the 2001 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233115/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper Awards|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was released on DVD on 7 January 2013.

A three part series of one hour episodes, ''The Yorkshire Ripper Files: A Very British Crime Story'' aired on [[BBC Four]] in March 2019. This included interviews with some of the victims, their family, police and journalists who covered the case by film-maker Liza Williams. In the series she questions whether the attitude of both the police and society towards women prevented Sutcliffe from being caught sooner.

A play written by Olivia Hirst and [[David Byrne (playwright)|David Byrne]], ''The Incident Room'', premiered at Pleasance as part of the 2019 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. The play focuses on the police force hunting the Yorkshire Ripper. The play was produced by [[New Diorama Theatre|New Diorama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/the-incident-room-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019|title=The Incident Room review – Yorkshire Ripper retelling puts police in the spotlight|last=Love|first=Catherine|date=2019-08-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Thomas Straffen''' (27 February 1930 – 19 November 2007) was an [[England|English]] [[serial killer]] who was the longest-serving prisoner in British legal history. Straffen killed two young girls in the summer of 1951. He was found to be [[unfit to plead]] and committed to [[Broadmoor Hospital]]; during a brief escape in 1952, he killed again. This time, Straffen was convicted of [[murder]] and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Reprieved because of his mental state, Straffen had his sentence [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]], and he remained in prison until his death more than 55&amp;nbsp;years later.

==Early life==
John Straffen's father, John Straffen Sr, was a soldier in the [[British Army]]. The younger Straffen was the third child in the family; his older sister was regarded as a "[[Intellectual_disability#Terminology|high grade mental defective]]" who died in 1952.&lt;ref name="fairfield2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen was born at [[Bordon and Longmoor Military Camps|Bordon Camp]] in [[Hampshire]] where his father was then based. When Straffen was two years old, his father was posted abroad, and the family spent six years in [[British Raj|India]]. Returning to Britain in March 1938, Straffen's father took a discharge from the Army, and the family settled in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="fairfield2" /&gt;

In October 1938, Straffen was referred to a child guidance clinic for stealing and [[truancy]]. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years [[probation]]. His probation officer found that Straffen did not understand the difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation.&lt;ref name="fairfield2" /&gt; The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his [[Intelligence Quotient|I.Q.]] as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in [[Sambourne]].&lt;ref name="fairfield4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Straffen moved to Besford Court, a senior school. He was noted as a solitary boy who took correction very badly. At 14 he was suspected of strangling two [[goose|geese]].&lt;ref name="fairfield4" /&gt; At the age of 16, the school authorities undertook a review which found his I.Q. was 64 and his mental age was nine years six months, recommending his discharge.&lt;ref name="fairfield5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career==
Straffen returned home to Bath in March 1946, where the [[Medical Officer of Health]] examined him and found he still warranted certification under the Mental Deficiency Act. After several short-term jobs, he found a place as a [[machinist]] in a clothing factory. Early in 1947, Straffen began to go into unoccupied homes and steal small items to hide them; he never took them home or gave the items to others. Straffen had no friends and began stealing without being enticed by others.&lt;ref name="fairfield5" /&gt;

On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl reported to police that a boy called John had [[assault]]ed her by putting his hand over her mouth and saying, "What would you do if I killed you? I have done it before." This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for [[burglary]] and, in his police interview, cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed in custody and the Medical Officer of [[Bristol (HM Prison)|Horfield prison]] examined him, certifying that he was [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]]. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in [[Bristol]] under the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.higgypop.com/urbex/hortham-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hortham was an "open" colony which specialised in training mentally disabled offenders for resettlement in the community. As he had been under investigation for burglary, Straffen's certificate stated that he was "not of violent or dangerous propensities." He was well-behaved at Hortham and kept away from other inmates. As a result, in July 1949, he was transferred to a lower-security agricultural [[hostel]] in [[Winchester]]. There he did well initially, but fell back into old ways when he stole a bag of walnuts and was sent back to Hortham in February 1950. In August 1950, Straffen got in trouble with Hortham authorities when he went home without leave and resisted the police when they went to recapture him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
In 1951, Straffen was examined at a Bristol hospital, where [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] readings showed that he had suffered "wide and severe damage to the [[cerebral cortex]], probably from an attack of [[encephalitis]] in India before the age of six." By now, however, Straffen was considered sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed a period of unescorted home leave. He used the time to get a job at a [[Market gardening|market garden]], which he was allowed to keep. Hortham licensed him to the care of his mother, as the family home was less overcrowded. When Straffen's 21st birthday came, under the Mental Deficiency Act, he had to be reassessed by Hortham, which continued his certificate for a further five years; the family disputed the assessment and appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Medical Officer of Health for Bath examined Straffen again on 10 July 1951 and found improvement in mental age to 10; he recommended that Straffen's certificate be renewed only for six months with a view to discharge at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child killings==
According to Letitia Fairfield in the introduction to the ''Notable British Trials'' series volume about Straffen, he had a "smouldering hatred" and an "intense resentment" of the police and blamed them for all his troubles from the age of eight. On the morning of Straffen's assessment, a young girl named Christine Butcher was murdered. Fairfield speculates that Straffen saw the press coverage that followed and made the connection that strangling young girls gave the maximum amount of trouble to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 1951, Straffen went to the cinema, on his own. His route took him past 1 [[Camden Crescent, Bath|Camden Crescent]] in Bath, where 5-year-old Brenda Goddard lived with her [[foster parent]]s. According to Straffen's later statement to the police, he saw Brenda gathering flowers and offered to show her a better place. He lifted Brenda over a fence into a [[coppicing|copse]], after which she fell and hit her head on a stone. She was unconscious, and he strangled her. Straffen did not make any attempt to hide the body and simply went on to the cinema, viewed the film ''[[Shockproof]]'', and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bath police had not previously suspected Straffen was violent, he was considered a suspect in the murder and interviewed by police on 3 August.&lt;ref name="Goddard suspicion"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 124 (Evidence of Thomas James Coles).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the police had visited his employer to check on his movements; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July.&lt;ref name="Sacked"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with a prison psychiatrist, Straffen said that he knew he was under suspicion and wanted to annoy the police, because he hated them for shadowing him.&lt;ref name="Police hatred"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 168-169 (Evidence of Dr Alexander Leitch).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August, Straffen was again at the cinema when he met 9-year-old Cicely Batstone. He first took Cicely to a different cinema to see another film and then went on the bus to a meadow known as "Tumps" on the outskirts of Bath. There he strangled her to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of the murder left many witnesses who had seen Straffen with the girl. The bus conductor recognised Straffen as a former workmate, a courting couple in the meadow had seen Straffen very closely, and a policeman's wife had also seen the two together. She mentioned it to her husband; when the alarm was raised the next morning, she guided police to where she had seen the two, and Cicely's body was discovered. Her description of the man was enough to identify Straffen immediately as the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
Accordingly, the police drove to Straffen's home and arrested him for the murder of Cicely on the morning of 9 August. Straffen made a statement admitting he had killed Cicely and also confessed to the murder of Brenda: "The other girl, I did her the same."&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 132-133 (Evidence of Albert Foster; statement of John Thomas Straffen).&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with murder and remanded in custody.&lt;ref name="Murder charge"&gt;"Man Charged With Girl's Murder", ''The Times'', 11 August 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August, after a two-day hearing at [[Magistrates' Court|Bath Magistrates' Court]], a date was set for Straffen's trial for the murder of Brenda.&lt;ref name="Committed for trial"&gt;"Alleged Murder Of Two Girls", ''The Times'', 1 September 1951, p. 3. English law at the time did not permit an indictment for more than a single charge of murder.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Taunton]] [[Assize Court]], on 17 October 1951, Straffen stood trial for murder before Mr Justice Oliver. However, the only witness to be heard was Dr Peter Parkes, medical officer at Horfield Prison, who testified to Straffen's medical history and stated his conclusion that Straffen was [[unfit to plead]]. Oliver commented, "In this country we do not try people who are [[insanity|insane]]. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried." The jury formally returned a verdict that Straffen was insane and unfit to plead.&lt;ref name="Unfit to plead"&gt;"Labourer Found Unfit To Plead", ''The Times'', 18 October 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen was transferred to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor hospital]] in [[Berkshire]]. Broadmoor had originally been termed a criminal lunatic asylum, but by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]], responsibility for it had been transferred to the Ministry of Health, and those committed to it had been renamed patients.&lt;ref name="Broadmoor Enquiry report"&gt;"Report of the Broadmoor Enquiry Committee" (Cmd 8594), paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Broadmoor, Straffen was given a job as a cleaner.

==Escape from Broadmoor and murder of Linda Bowyer==
On 29 April 1952, Straffen went with an attendant and another patient to clean some outbuildings that were close to the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 20 minutes after escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in [[Crowthorne]] and approached Mrs. Doris Spencer, who was in her garden. He asked her for a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor and the likelihood of escapes. He left after 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="Mrs Spencer"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 90 (Evidence of Mrs Doris Evelyn Spencer).&lt;/ref&gt; An hour and a half later, he reached [[Farley Hill, Berkshire|Farley Hill]], and at about five o'clock, Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Half an hour later, Bowyer was dead.&lt;ref name="Bowyer murder"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen then begged a cup of tea from another householder, Mrs Kenyon, who agreed to drive him to a bus stop. As they were drawing up to the stop, Straffen saw some men in uniform and asked whether they were police; on learning that they were, he quickly got out of the car and ran. Kenyon told the men (who were actually Broadmoor nurses) of the suspicious behaviour of her passenger, and Straffen was caught a few minutes later. Driven in the car on the journey back to Broadmoor, Straffen said, "I have finished with crime." Linda's body was found the next morning.&lt;ref name="Broadmoor Escape"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police went to Broadmoor to interview Straffen at 8am, arriving before news of the disappearance and murder of a local child had reached the hospital. The police went to Straffen's room and woke him up, then asking him what he had done when he was free and whether he had got into mischief. Straffen replied, "I did not kill her." The inspector told Straffen that no-one had suggested anyone had been killed, and Straffen said: "I know what you policemen are, I know I killed two little children but I did not kill the little girl." The inspector then confirmed that a girl had been killed near where Straffen was recaptured. Straffen said, "I did not kill the little girl on the bicycle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen then made a long statement, which the police checked. On 1 May, Straffen was charged with the murder of Linda, and he appeared at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] Magistrates' Court the following day. He was remanded in custody, and despite the fact of the order committing him to Broadmoor, the magistrates decided that, since they had failed to hold him, he should be sent to HMP Brixton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health called for a full inquiry into how Straffen had escaped.&lt;ref name="Escape inquiry"&gt;"Inquiry Into Escape From Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 1 May 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of local residents held a meeting on the same evening as Straffen's court appearance to call for some system of public warning of an escape.&lt;ref name="Protest meeting"&gt;"Protest Meeting Near Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 3 May 1952, p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health inquiry was extended to a full independent inquiry.&lt;ref name="Inquiry extended"&gt;"Further Inquiry On Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 7 May 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broadmoor Sirens|A system of warning sirens]] was set up later in 1952 as a result of the inquiry recommendations.&lt;ref name="Warning system"&gt;"Security Measures At Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 17 October 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bowyer murder trial==
When Straffen's murder trial opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted to leave the question of his sanity as an issue to be determined by the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]], Sir [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Reginald Manningham-Buller]]) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda, they applied to call additional evidence about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day, the judge was late into court and explained that "owing to the alleged conduct of one of your members," he was compelled to discharge them and start again with a new jury. It turned out that one of the first set of jurors had gone to a political club in [[Southsea]] in the evening and told those present that he was on the jury for the Straffen case, that Straffen was not guilty, and that one of the prosecution witnesses had murdered Linda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge required the errant juror, William Gladwin, to remain in court throughout the trial, before calling him to apologise for his "wicked discharge of your duties as a citizen".&lt;ref name="William Gladwin"&gt;"Straffen Guilty Of Murder", ''The Times'', 26 July 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day's proceedings were repeated before the second jury, followed, as permitted, by evidence of what had happened in Bath. Straffen's defence called several of those who had seen Straffen in earlier years to give evidence of his mental condition. The prosecution then called prison medical officers and psychiatrists to give evidence in rebuttal. Dr. Thomas Munro, who was a specialist in mental deficiency and had seen Straffen, testified that he had said that to murder was wrong because it was breaking the law and because "it is one of the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]]". When Munro asked Straffen to name the other commandments, Straffen could remember only four.&lt;ref name="Commandments"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 204-205 (Evidence of Dr Thomas Arthur Howard Munro).&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring for just under an hour, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty, which implicitly declared Straffen sane. Mr Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death]].&lt;ref name="Verdict and sentence"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen [[appeal]]ed, on the grounds that the evidence about the Bath murders was wrongly admitted, and that his statements on the morning after the murder of Linda Bowyer were wrongly admitted because they had been made before he was cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed,&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD, and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 264-273.&lt;/ref&gt; and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="No Lords appeal"&gt;"Straffen Refused House of Lords Appeal", ''The Times'', 27 August 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 September was fixed as the date for execution of judgment of death.&lt;ref name="Execution fixed"&gt;''The Times'', 28 August 1952, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 29 August, it was announced that [[Home Secretary]] [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]] had recommended to [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] that Straffen be reprieved.&lt;ref name="Reprieve"&gt;"Reprieve Recommended for Straffen", ''The Times'', 30 August 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprieve and prison==
After his reprieve, Straffen was moved to [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]]. In November 1952, the Home Office denied a rumour that he was about to be moved to the [[Rampton Secure Hospital|Rampton]] mental institution.&lt;ref name="No Rampton move"&gt;"Straffen 'Unlikely to be Moved'", ''The Times'', 3 November 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Straffen was moved to Horfield Prison after officers discovered an escape attempt by Wandsworth prisoners who intended to take Straffen with them as a diversion.&lt;ref name="Horfield move"&gt;"Parliament", ''The Times'', 20 April 1956, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The news caused extreme concern in Bristol, and a petition demanding his removal was organised by a local councillor and signed by 12,000 people within weeks.&lt;ref name="Horfield transfer"&gt;"Film Protests On Straffen Denied", ''The Times'', 25 May 1956, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Horfield, Straffen was described by former politician [[Peter Baker (British politician)|Peter Baker]], briefly a fellow prisoner, as always being conspicuous when he was exercising, being much taller than anyone else and wearing distinctive clothing for a special watch prisoner. Baker thought the "long, emaciated, miserable figure" looked "like a dying butterfly or a caged animal" and reported rumours that Straffen made application to the governor every month to see if a date had been set for his release.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Baker, "Time Out of Life", Heinemann, 1961, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1958, Straffen was moved to [[Cardiff (HM Prison)|Cardiff Prison]] when the regime at Horfield was changed to a more liberal one.&lt;ref name="Cardiff transfer"&gt;"Straffen Transferred", ''The Times'', 25 August 1958, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was reported to have been transferred back in June 1960.&lt;ref name="Back to Horfield"&gt;"Straffen Transferred Report", ''The Times'', 7 June 1960, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new 28-cell high-security wing at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst Prison]] was built and ready for opening early in 1966. The Home Office pointedly did not deny rumours that Straffen had been secretly transferred there on 31 January 1966.&lt;ref name="Parkhurst move"&gt;"Straffen Transferred?", ''The Times'', 2 February 1966, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to arrive, and was followed by six of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train robbers]].&lt;ref name="Parkhurst companions"&gt;"Train Robbers Have A Car Each In Transfer", ''The Times'', 5 February 1966, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1968, Straffen was moved to [[Durham (HM Prison)|Durham Prison]].&lt;ref name="Durham move"&gt;"Straffen moved", ''The Times'', 23 May 1968, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Placed in the top security E wing, Straffen was joined by fellow child killer [[Ian Brady]]. Crime author Jonathan Goodman wrote that "the shambling lunatic [Straffen] .. is in prison only because no mental institution is secure enough to guarantee his confinement".&lt;ref name="Jonathan Goodman"&gt;"The Trial of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley", ed. by Jonathan Goodman (Celebrated Trials Series, David &amp; Charles, 1973), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, a prison officer recalled seeing Straffen "circling, banging the fence every couple of minutes", and that one fellow officer described him as aloof and hostile: "Never talks unless he has to ask for something. Always on his own".&lt;ref name="Life in Durham"&gt;Mitya Underwood, "Lifting the lid on my prison life", ''Evening Chronicle'', 6 August 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen was still at Durham Prison in January 1984 when Kenneth Barlow was released after serving 26 years for murder, at which point he became the longest serving British prisoner.&lt;ref name="Longest serving"&gt;"Man to be freed after 26 years", ''The Times'', 31 December 1983, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing terms===
For most of the time that Straffen was in prison, the Home Secretary had to agree to the release of any life sentence prisoner; no occupant of the office was ever willing to let Straffen out. In 1994, [[Michael Howard]] decided to compile a select list of about 20 prisoners serving life sentences who must never be released, and Straffen's name was said to be on it.&lt;ref name="No release"&gt;''Sunday Telegraph'', 3 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole list was published by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in December 1997; this report confirmed that Straffen would indeed spend the rest of his life in prison.

In 2001, with the 50th anniversary of Straffen's imprisonment approaching, his solicitors called for his case to be reopened on the grounds that he had not been fit to stand trial.&lt;ref name="Reopen case"&gt;"Killer jail review", ''Birmingham Mail'', 26 May 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Bob Woffinden]], who examined previously confidential records, uncovered that Straffen had been reprieved after a majority of doctors who examined him found that he was insane.&lt;ref name="Insane at trial"&gt;Bob Woffinden, "Historic murder case may reopen: Uncovered records could liberate UK's longest serving prisoner", ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Woffinden also doubted Straffen's guilt in the murder of Linda, because Straffen had no fingernails with which to cause injuries seen on her body and because some local witnesses placed the time of the murder after his recapture.&lt;ref name="Guilt doubts"&gt;Bob Woffinden, "Insane, guilty or neither?", ''The Guardian'' Weekend Section, 26 May 2001, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straffen's application to the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] was turned down in December 2002.&lt;ref name="CCRC refused"&gt;"Child-Killer To Die In Prison", ''Western Daily Press'', 3 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] decided a case brought by a life sentence prisoner which challenged the authority of the Home Secretary to refuse to release him after the [[Parole Board]] recommended he be freed. The court decided that politicians should not interfere in life sentences and therefore current practice was unlawful. It was immediately noted that this meant an opportunity for release for Straffen,&lt;ref name="ECHR judgment"&gt;Dan McDougall, Arthur MacMillan, "Human Rights court rules government must not interfere in life sentences", ''Scotsman'', 29 May 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been in [[Long Lartin (HM Prison)|Long Lartin Prison]] since 2000.

==Death==
Straffen died at [[Frankland (HM Prison)|Frankland Prison]] in [[County Durham]] on 19 November 2007 at the age of 77. He had been in prison for a British record of 55&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2213663,00.html|title=Longest-serving UK prisoner dies, aged 77 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | date=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Brady]], who had been in prison since October 1965 and was then in [[Ashworth Hospital]], became Britain's longest-serving prisoner until his own death ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;Yakub Qureshi, "Final farewell for Moors murder victim Keith Bennett", ''Manchester Evening News'', 4 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Joseph Smith''' (11 January 1872 – 13 August 1915) was an [[English people|English]] [[serial killer]] and [[bigamy|bigamist]]. In 1915, he was [[criminal conviction|convicted]] and subsequently [[hanging|hanged]] for the murders of three women, the case becoming known as the '''Brides in the Bath Murders'''. As well as being widely reported in the media, the case was significant in the history of [[forensic pathology]] and detection. It was also one of the first cases in which similarities between connected crimes were used to prove deliberation, a technique used in subsequent [[prosecution]]s.

== Early life and marriages ==
The son of an insurance agent, George Joseph Smith was born in [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]]. He was sent to a [[reformatory]] at [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], at the age of nine and later served time for [[Fraud|swindling]] and [[theft]]. In 1896, he was imprisoned for twelve months for persuading a woman to steal from her employers. He used the proceeds to open a baker's shop in [[Leicester]].

In 1898, under the [[Pseudonym|alias]] Oliver George Love, Smith married Caroline Beatrice Thornhill in Leicester; it was his only legal marriage (although he also married another woman [[bigamy|bigamously]] the following year). They moved to London, where she worked as a maid for a number of employers, stealing from them for her husband. She was eventually caught in [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]], and sentenced to twelve months. On her release, she incriminated her husband, and he was imprisoned in January 1901 for two years. On his release, she fled to [[Canada]]. Smith then went back to his other wife, cleared out her savings, and left.

In June 1908, Smith married Florence Wilson, a widow from Worthing. On 3 July, he left her, but not before taking [[Pound sterling|£]]30 ({{Inflation|UK|30|1908|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) drawn from her [[savings account]] and selling her belongings from their [[Camden Town|Camden]] residence in London. On 30 July, in [[Bristol]], Smith married Edith Peglar, who had replied to an advertisement for a [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]. He would disappear for months at a time, saying that he was going to another city to ply his trade, which he claimed was selling [[antique]]s. In between his other marriages, Smith would always come back to Peglar with money.

In October 1909, Smith married Sarah Freeman, under the name George Rose Smith. As with Wilson, he left her after clearing out her savings and selling her [[war bond]]s, with a total take of £400. He then married Bessie Mundy and Alice Burnham. In September 1914, he married Alice Reid, under the alias Charles Oliver James. In total, Smith entered into seven bigamous marriages between 1908 and 1914. In most of these cases, Smith went through his wives' possessions before he disappeared.

== Two similar deaths ==
In January 1915, Division [[Detective Inspector]] [[Arthur Neil]] received a letter from a Joseph Crossley, who owned a [[boarding house]] in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]]. Included with the letter were two newspaper clippings: one was from the ''[[News of the World]]'' dated before Christmas 1914, about the death of Margaret Elizabeth Lloyd (''née'' Lofty), aged 38, who died in her lodgings in 14 Bismarck Road, [[Highgate]], London (later renamed Waterlow Road). She was found in her bathtub by her husband, John Lloyd, and their [[landlady]].

The other clipping contained the report of a [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] dated 13 December 1913, in Blackpool. It was about a woman named Alice Smith (''née'' Burnham), who died suddenly in a boarding house in that seaside resort while in her bathtub. She was found by her husband, George Smith. Alice was not an heiress but had worked hard and saved money. Additionally, Smith took out a [[life insurance]] policy on his wife worth £500 ({{Inflation|UK|500|1913|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).&lt;ref name="casebook"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brides in the Bath|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhw_o6ePWwA|accessdate=22 June 2017|work=Fred Dinenage: Murder Casebook|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, dated 3 January, was written by Crossley, the [[landlord]] of Mr and Mrs Smith, on behalf of Crossley's wife and a Mr. Charles Burnham, who both expressed their suspicion on the striking similarity of the two incidents and urged the police to investigate the matter.

== The hunt ==
On 17 December 1913, Neil went to 14 Bismarck Road, where the Lloyds had taken lodgings. He found it hard to believe that an adult like Mrs Lloyd could have drowned in such a small tub, especially since the tub was three-quarters full when she was found. He then interviewed the [[coroner]], a Dr. Bates, who had signed the [[death certificate]], and asked if there were signs of violence on the woman. There were none except for a tiny bruise above the left elbow.

Upon further investigation, Neil learned that a [[will (law)|will]] had been made on the 18th, three hours before Mrs Lloyd died, and the sole [[beneficiary]] was her husband who had submitted the will to a lawyer "for settlement". In addition, she had withdrawn all her savings on that same day.

On 12 January, Dr. Bates called Neil with an inquiry from the Yorkshire Insurance Company regarding the death of Mrs Lloyd. She had, three days before she was married, taken out a life insurance policy for £700 ({{Inflation|UK|700|1913|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), with her husband John as sole beneficiary. Neil promptly asked the doctor to delay his reply. At the same time, he requested more information on the Smith case from the Blackpool police. Similarly, the late Mrs Smith had earlier taken out a life insurance policy, and made a will in her husband's favour, and she took the lodgings in Blackpool only after Mr Smith inspected the bathtub.

Neil asked the coroner to issue a favourable report to the insurance company. He was counting on the suspect to get in touch with his lawyer, and the office was watched day and night. On 1 February, a man fitting Lloyd/Smith's description appeared. Neil introduced himself and asked him whether he was John Lloyd. After Lloyd answered in the affirmative, Neil then asked him whether he was also George Smith. The man denied it vehemently. Neil, already sure that Lloyd and Smith were the same man, told him that he would take him for questioning on suspicion of bigamy. The man finally admitted that he was indeed Smith, and was arrested.

== Spilsbury enters the case ==
When Smith was arrested for the charge of bigamy and suspicion of murder, the [[pathologist]] [[Bernard Spilsbury]] was asked to determine how the women died.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose, ''Lethal Witness'', Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was the [[Home Office]] [[pathologist]] and acted mainly in a consulting capacity, he was also available for direct assistance to the police force.

Margaret Lloyd's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]], and Spilsbury's first task was to confirm [[drowning]] as the cause of death; and if so, whether by accident or by force. He confirmed the tiny bruise on the elbow as noted before, as well as two microscopic marks. Even the evidence of drowning was not extensive. There were no signs of [[heart disease|heart]] or [[circulatory disease]], but the evidence suggested that death was almost instantaneous, as if the victim died of a sudden [[stroke]]. Poison was also seen as a possibility, and Spilsbury ordered tests on its presence. Finally, he proposed to Neil that they run some experiments in the very same bathtub in which Mrs Lloyd died. Neil had it set up in the police station.

Newspaper reports about the "Brides in the Baths" began to appear. On 8 February, the [[chief police officer]] of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]], a small seaside resort in [[Kent]], had read the stories, and sent Neil a report of another death which was strikingly similar to the other two.

== A third victim ==
A year before Burnham's death in Blackpool, one Henry Williams had rented a house with no bath in 80 High Street, for himself and his wife, Beatrice "Bessie" Mundy, whom he had married in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Dorset]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=James |title=Murder by Numbers - Fascinating Figures Behind The World's Worst Crimes |publisher=History Press |location=2018 |isbn=9780750981453 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then rented a bathtub seven weeks later. He took his wife to a local [[General practitioner|GP]], Dr Frank French, due to an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] fit, although she was only complaining of headaches, for which the doctor prescribed some medication.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; On 12 July 1912, Williams woke French, saying that his wife was having another fit.[[File:GeorgeJosephSmithBridesintheBath1914BessieMundya.jpg|150px|thumb|George Joseph Smith and Bessie Mundy, pictured shortly before her murder]] He checked on her, and promised to come back the following afternoon. However, he was surprised when, on the following morning, he was informed by Williams that his wife had died of drowning. The doctor found Bessie in the tub, her head under water, her legs stretched out straight and her feet protruding out of the water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; There was no trace of violence, so French attributed the drowning to epilepsy. The inquest [[jury]] awarded Williams the amount of £2,579 13s 7d (£2,579.68p) ({{Inflation|UK|2579|1912|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), as stipulated in Mrs Williams' will, made up five days before her death.

Neil then sent photographs of Smith to Herne Bay for possible identification, and then went to Blackpool, where Spilsbury was conducting an [[autopsy]] of Alice Smith. The results were the same as with Margaret Lloyd: the lack of violence, every suggestion of instantaneous death, and little evidence of drowning. Furthermore, there were no traces of poison on Margaret Lloyd. Baffled, Spilsbury routinely took measurements of the corpse and had the tub sent to London.

Back in London, Neil had received confirmation from Herne Bay. "Henry Williams" was also "John Lloyd" and "George Smith". This time, when Spilsbury examined Bessie Williams, he found one sure sign of drowning: the presence of [[Goose bumps|goose pimples]] on the skin on her thigh. As with the other two deaths, the tub in which Mrs Williams had died was sent to London.

== Solution ==
For weeks, Spilsbury pondered over the bathtubs and the victims' measurements. The first stage of an epileptic fit consists of a stiffening and extension of the entire body. Considering Bessie Williams' height (5 feet, 7 inches) and the length of the tub (5 feet), the upper part of her body would have been pushed up the sloping head of the tub, far above the level of the water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; The second stage consists of violent spasms of the limbs, which were drawn up to the body and then flung outward. Therefore, no one of her size could possibly get under water, even when her muscles were relaxed, in the third stage: the tub was simply too small.

Using French's description of Bessie Williams when he found her in the bathtub, Spilsbury reasoned that Smith must have seized her by the feet and suddenly pulled them up toward himself, sliding the upper part of the body under water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; The sudden flood of water into her nose and throat might cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and sudden loss of consciousness, explaining the absence of injuries and minimal signs of drowning.

Neil hired several experienced female divers of the same size and build as the victims. He tried to push them under water by force but there would be inevitable signs of struggle. Neil then unexpectedly pulled the feet of one of the divers, and her head glided underwater before she knew what happened. Suddenly Neil saw that the woman was no longer moving. He quickly pulled her out of the tub and it took him and a doctor over half an hour to revive her.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; When she came to, she related that the only thing she remembered was the rush of water before she lost consciousness. Thus was Spilsbury's theory confirmed.

George Joseph Smith was arrested 15 February 1915 and formally charged for the murders of Bessie Williams, Alice Smith and Margaret Lloyd on 23 March 1915.

== Trial and legal legacy ==
On 22 June, the trial began at the [[Old Bailey]]. The prosecuting counsel were [[Archibald Bodkin]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]), [[Cecil Whiteley]] (later [[Queen's Counsel|KC]]) and [[Travers Humphreys]] (later Mr Justice Humphreys).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Murder|last= Wilson|first= Colin|authorlink= |author2=Patricia Pitman |year= 1984|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 978-0-330-28300-7|pages= 577–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Trial of George Joseph Smith|last= Watson|first= ER (Ed)|authorlink= |year= 1922|publisher= [[William Hodge]]|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he could only be tried for the murder of Bessie Mundy in accordance with [[English law]], the [[prosecution]] used the deaths of the other two to establish the pattern of Smith's crimes; this was allowed by [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|Mr Justice Scrutton]] despite the protests of Smith's [[barrister|counsel]], [[Edward Marshall Hall|Sir Edward Marshall Hall]]. Smith elected not to give evidence in his own defence, indicating this to Marshall Hall in a handwritten note (pictured).
[[File:Smith's instructions to counsel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Smith's handwritten note to Marshall Hall]]

It took the jury about 20 minutes on 1 July to find him guilty; he was then [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]. Marshall Hall [[appeal]]ed on the grounds that the evidence of "system" has been improperly admitted, but [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading LCJ]] dismissed the appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Famous cases: nine trials that changed the law | author1=Brian P. Block | author2=John Hostettler | publisher=Waterside Press| year=2002 | isbn=978-1-872870-34-2 | pages=225–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith was hanged in [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Prison]] on 13 August by hangman [[John Ellis (executioner)|John Ellis]].

The use of 'system'—comparing other crimes to the one a criminal is being tried for to prove guilt—set a [[precedent]] that was later used in other murder trials. For example, the doctor and suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]] was charged for the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell]], but the deaths of [[Gertrude Hullett]] and her husband Jack were used in the committal hearing to prove the existence of a pattern. This use of 'system' was later criticised by the trial judge when Adams was tried only on the Morrell charge.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Patrick. Easing the passing: The trial of Doctor John Bodkin Adams, London, The Bodley Head, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==

In his book ''[[Why Britain is at War]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Why Britain is at War" (1939) by Harold Nicolson, republished as {{ISBN|978-0-14-104896-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] used Smith's repeatedly murderous behaviour as a parallel to Hitler's repeatedly acquisitive behaviour in Europe in the 1930s.
In Evelyn Waugh's book ''[[Unconditional Surrender (novel)|Unconditional Surrender]]'', which is set during the Second World War, General Whale is referred to as "Brides-in-the-bath" because all the operations he sponsored seemed to require the extermination of all involved.

The Smith case is mentioned in Dorothy L. Sayers' mysteries ''[[Unnatural Death (novel)|Unnatural Death]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''[[Unnatural Death (novel)]]'', Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Busman's Honeymoon]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers, ''[Busman's Honeymoon]'', Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as in Agatha Christie's ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' and ''[[The Murder on the Links]]''. It is also mentioned on Patricia Highsmith's novel ''[[A Suspension of Mercy]]'' at page 63: "Not for him the Smith brides-in-a-bath murders for peanuts." The crimes of George Joseph Smith also feature in William Trevor's novel ''[[The Children of Dynmouth]]'' in which the sociopathic protagonist plans to re-enact the crimes as part of the community's Easter Fete. On page 273 of Monica Ferris's novel "The Drowning Spool," it mentions "a certain George Joseph Smith" who is discovered through the work of "a very clever forensic investigator back then." [[Margery Allingham]]'s short story "Three Is a Lucky Number" (1955) adapts the events and refers to James Joseph Smith and his brides. The Smith case was dramatised on the radio series ''[[The Black Museum]]'' in 1952 under the title of ''The Bath Tub''. Czechoslovak Television's series ''Adventures of Criminology'' (1990), based on famous criminal cases in which new methods of investigation were used, depicts this case in the episode ''Reconstruction''. The protagonist of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1968 short story "[[An American Organ]]" wishes to emulate Smith by murdering his wife in a bath.

Smith is mentioned and features at [[Madame Tussauds]] museum in the 1969 [[Special Branch]] episode 'You Don't Exist'. A missing episode of ''[[Dead of Night (TV series)|Dead of Night]]'' (1972), a [[BBC2]] paranormal anthology series, entitled ''Smith'' concerned Smith's spirit possessing a man and re-enacting one of his murders. [[Silent Witness]] episode ''Fatal Error'' (2003) contains a reference to the case in connection with a series of murders based on forensic pathology textbook examples. There was also ''[[The Brides in the Bath]]'' (2003), a TV film made by [[Yorkshire Television]], starring [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]] as George Smith and the play [[Tryst (drama)|''Tryst'']] by [[Karoline Leach]], first produced in New York in 2006, starring [[Maxwell Caulfield]] and [[Amelia Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wild-reality.net/tryst/ |title=TRYST |publisher=wild-reality.net |accessdate=2010-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story is the basis for the play ''The Drowning Girls'' by Beth Graham, Charlie Tomlinson, Daniela Vlaskalic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/stage/2009/10/16/11420751-sun.html | journal=Toronto Sun | date=16 October 2009 | author=John Coulbourn | title=

For some years, Smith's waxwork was exhibited in the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]] at [[Madame Tussauds]] in London.

The 1949 movie ''[[Obsession (1949 film)|Obsession]]'' mentions the brides in the bath case.

'''Harold Frederick Shipman''' (14 January 1946&amp;nbsp;– 13 January 2004), known to his family and friends as '''Fred Shipman''', was an [[English people|English]] [[general practitioner]] and is believed to be [[List of serial killers by number of victims|the most prolific serial killer in history]]. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of the murder of 15 patients under his care, with his total number of victims estimated to be around 250. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with the recommendation that he [[whole life tariff|never be released]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3391897.stm |title=Harold Shipman: The killer doctor|work= BBC News|date= 13 January 2004|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Shipman Inquiry]], a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by [[Janet Smith (judge)|Dame Janet Smith]], examined Shipman's crimes. The inquiry identified 215 victims and estimated his total victim count at 250, about 80% of whom were elderly women. Shipman's youngest confirmed victim was a 41-year-old man,&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |title=The Shipman Inquiry |publisher=The Shipman Inquiry |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413134928/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |archivedate=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although "significant suspicion" arose that he had killed patients as young as four.&lt;ref name = "killed early"/&gt;

Much of the [[United Kingdom]]'s legal structure concerning [[health care]] and medicine was reviewed and modified as a result of Shipman's crimes. He is the only British doctor to have been found guilty of murdering his patients, although other doctors have been [[acquittal|acquitted]] of similar crimes or convicted on lesser charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Stovold |url=http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm |title=The Case of Dr. John Bodkin Adams |publisher=Strangerinblood.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman committed suicide on 13 January 2004, one day before his 58th birthday, by [[suicide by hanging|hanging himself]] in his cell at [[Wakefield Prison]].

==Early life and career==
Harold Frederick Shipman was born on the [[Bestwood Estate|Bestwood council estate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=Portrait of a necrophiliac|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/13/shipman.health|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nottingham]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]], the second of the three children of Harold Frederick Shipman (12 May 1914 – 5 January 1985), a lorry driver, and Vera Brittan (23 December 1919 – 21 June 1963).&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swan|first=Norman|title=Why Some Doctors Kill|pages=|publisher=The Health Report|date=29 July 2002|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2002/636389.htm|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert M.|title=Medical Murder: Disturbing Cases of Doctors Who Kill|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2009|pages=59–60|isbn=978-1-74175-610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His working-class parents were devout [[Methodism|Methodists]].&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"/&gt; When growing up, Shipman was an accomplished [[rugby football|rugby]] player in youth leagues.

Shipman passed his [[eleven-plus]] in 1957, moving to High Pavement Grammar School, Nottingham, which he left in 1964. He excelled as a distance runner, and in his final year at school served as vice-captain of the athletics team. Shipman was particularly close to his mother, who died of [[lung cancer]] when he was 17.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Born to Kill?]]'', [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbert|first=Ian|title=How a humble GP perverted his medical skill to become Britain's most prolific mass killer|date=14 January 2004|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-a-humble-gp-perverted-his-medical-skill-to-become-britains-most-prolific-mass-killer-573066.html|accessdate=2 September 2009|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death came in a manner similar to what later became Shipman's own ''[[modus operandi]]'': in the later stages of her disease, she had [[morphine]] administered at home by a doctor. Shipman witnessed his mother's pain subside, despite her terminal condition, until her death on 21 June 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/shipman/die_3.html] The Early Life of Harold Shipman&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 1966, Shipman married Primrose May Oxtoby. They had four children together.

Shipman studied medicine at [[Leeds School of Medicine]], graduating in 1970.&lt;ref name="bbc2002"/&gt; He began working at Pontefract General Infirmary in [[Pontefract]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], and in 1974 took his first position as a [[general practitioner]] (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in [[Todmorden]]. In the following year, he was caught forging prescriptions of [[pethidine]] (Demerol) for his own use. He was fined £600, and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in [[York]]. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] near [[Manchester]], in 1977.&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harold Shipman: Timeline|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2136444.stm|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bunyan|first=Nigel|title=The Killing Fields of Harold Shipman|pages=|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 June 2001|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724155/The-Killing-Fields-of-Harold-Shipman.html|accessdate=1 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s, and established his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993, becoming a respected member of the community. In 1983, he was interviewed in an edition of the [[Granada Television]] documentary ''[[World in Action]]'' on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/shipman/uncovering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022183541/http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/shipman/uncovering/ |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after his conviction, the interview was re-broadcast on ''[[Tonight with Trevor McDonald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1159420.stm |title=Shipman interview rebroadcast |work=BBC News |date=8 February 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
In March 1998, Linda Reynolds of the Donneybrook Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Sons funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the [[coroner]] for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of [[cremation]] forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; the Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/secondreport.asp|title=Second Report&amp;nbsp;— The Police Investigation of March 1998 (Cm 5853)|date=14 July 2003|publisher=The Shipman Inquiry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305085744/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/secondreport.asp|archivedate=5 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3064231.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman inquiry criticises police|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=30 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, Hyde taxi driver John Shaw contacted the police, informing them that he suspected Shipman of murdering twenty-one of his patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3152204.stm|title=I feel guilty over Shipman killings|date=30 September 2003|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman's last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. He was the last person to see her alive; he later signed her [[death certificate]], recording "old age" as the [[cause of death]]. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when [[solicitor]] Brian Burgess informed her that a [[will and testament|will]] had been made, apparently by her mother; there were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict, and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, examination of his computer showed that they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a [[Brother Industries|Brother]] [[typewriter]] of the kind used to make the [[forgery|forged]] will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=The Shipman tapes I|date=31 January 2000|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/the_shipman_murders/the_shipman_files/613286.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of fifteen specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Doctor 'forged victim's medical history'|date=8 November 1999|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/510002.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prescription For Murder'', a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, advanced two theories on Shipman's [[motive (law)|motive]] for forging the will: that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or that he planned to retire at the age of 55 and leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, B and Richie, J. ''Prescription for Murder: The True Story of Dr. Harold Frederick Shipman''. Little Brown (2000), pp. 348–9. {{ISBN|0751529982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[David Spiegelhalter]] ''et al.'' suggested that "statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998."&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelhalter, D. ''et al.'' [http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/7.full.pdf Risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio tests: application to Bristol, Shipman and adult cardiac surgery.] ''Int J Qual Health Care'', vol. 15, pp. 7–13 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
Shipman's trial began at [[Preston Crown Court]] on 5 October 1999. He was charged with the murders of 15 women by lethal injections of [[Heroin|diamorphine]], all between 1995 and 1998.

His legal representatives tried unsuccessfully to have the Grundy case, where a clear motive was alleged, tried separately from the others where no motive was apparent.

On 31 January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen counts of murder and one count of forgery. [[Thayne Forbes|Mr Justice Forbes]] subsequently sentenced Shipman to [[life imprisonment]] on all fifteen counts of murder, with a recommendation that he [[whole life tariff|never be released]], to be served concurrently with a sentence of four years for forging Grundy's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/616692.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman jailed for 15 murders|date=31 January 2000|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 February 2000, ten days after his conviction, the [[General Medical Council]] formally struck Shipman off its register. Two years later, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] confirmed the judge's whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers [[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|lost their power]] to set minimum terms for prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/gmc-strikes-shipman-off-medical-register-725618.html|work=The Independent|title=GMC strikes Shipman off medical register|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010|location=London|first1=Maxine|last1=Frith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/638291.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman struck off|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While authorities could have brought many additional charges, they concluded that a fair hearing would be impossible in view of the enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Furthermore, the fifteen life sentences already handed down rendered further litigation unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 ''[[The Shipman Inquiry]]''&amp;nbsp;— Sixth Report&amp;nbsp;— Conclusions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413134928/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |date=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4212627.stm|title=Shipman's 'reckless' experiments|date=27 January 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman consistently denied his guilt, disputing the scientific evidence against him. He never made any public statements about his actions. Shipman's wife, Primrose, steadfastly maintained her husband's innocence, even after his conviction.&lt;ref name="Sweet2004"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/16/gender.uk|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=He could do no wrong|date=16 January 2004|accessdate=4 May 2010|first=Corinne|last=Sweet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman is the only doctor in the history of British medicine found guilty of murdering his patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm Strangerinblood.co.uk] [[Nigel Cox (doctor)|Nigel Cox]] was convicted of attempted murder in 1992, in the death of Lillian Boyes.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bodkin Adams]] was charged in 1957 with murdering a patient, amid rumours he had killed dozens more over a 10-year period and "possibly provided the role model for Shipman". However, he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinnell |first=HG |title=Serial homicide by doctors: Shipman in perspective |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1594–7 |year=2000 |pmid=11124192 |pmc=1119267 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Pamela Cullen has argued that because of Adams' acquittal, there was no impetus to examine the flaws in the British system until the Shipman case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last= Stovold|url=http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm|title=Strangerinblood.co.uk|publisher=Strangerinblood.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Shipman hanged&lt;!--the word "hanged" is correct in this context--&gt; himself in his cell at [[Wakefield Prison]] at 6:20&amp;nbsp;am on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 8:10&amp;nbsp;am. A [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison Service]] statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3391871.stm|date=13 January 2004|title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession, nor answers as to why he committed his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3392135.stm|date=13 January 2004|work=BBC News|title=No mourning from Shipman families}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] noted that celebration was tempting, saying: "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle? And then you discover that everybody's very upset that he's done it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3404041.stm|title=Blunkett admits Shipman error|date=16 January 2004 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death divided national newspapers, with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' branding him a "cold coward" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. However, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran a celebratory front-page headline; "Ship Ship hooray!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon|title=Is it the Sun that's gone bonkers?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/19/sun.mondaymediasection|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=19 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3395065.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shipman's death divides papers | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', an article by Sir [[David Ramsbotham]], a former [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons|Chief Inspector of Prisons]], suggested that [[whole life tariff|whole life sentencing]] be replaced by [[indefinite sentencing]], for this would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, though he reportedly told his [[probation officer]] that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his [[NHS Pension Scheme|National Health Service (NHS) pension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3611019.stm|date=8 April 2004|title=Shipman leaves his wife £24,000|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension; she would not have been entitled to it if Shipman had lived past 60.&lt;ref name="Not preventable"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4182730.stm|title=Shipman suicide 'not preventable'|work=BBC News|date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman refused to take part in courses which would have encouraged acknowledgement of his crimes, leading to a temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife.&lt;ref name="Not preventable"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3391871.stm | work=BBC News | title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell | date=13 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to, "Tell me everything, no matter what."&lt;ref name="Sweet2004" /&gt; A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman's suicide "could not have been predicted or prevented," but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined.&lt;ref name="Not preventable" /&gt;
&lt;!--
Some asked why he had not been on [[suicide watch]] at HMP Wakefield, even though he had been earlier at [[Manchester (HM Prison)|HMP Manchester]] and [[Frankland (HM Prison)|HMP Frankland]] after threatening to kill himself.
--&gt;

==Aftermath==
In January 2001, [[Chris Gregg]], a senior [[West Yorkshire]] detective, was selected to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How many more did Shipman kill? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-many-more-did-shipman-kill-630689.html |date=9 October 2001 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the Shipman Inquiry into Shipman's activities, submitted in July 2002, concluded that he had killed at least 215 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practiced in Todmorden, West Yorkshire (1974–1975), and [[Hyde, Greater Manchester]] (1977–1998). Dame [[Janet Smith (judge)|Janet Smith]], the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more deaths of a suspicious nature could not be definitively ascribed to him. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health.&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"/&gt;

In her sixth and final report, issued on 24 January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at Pontefract General Infirmary in [[Pontefract]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In total, 459 people died while under his care between 1971 and 1998, but it is uncertain how many of those were murder victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death. Smith's estimate of Shipman's total victim count over that 27-year period was 250.&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "killed early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4210581.stm |work=BBC News |title=Shipman 'killed early in career'|date=27 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Medical Council]] charged six doctors, who signed cremation forms for Shipman's victims, with misconduct, claiming they should have noticed the pattern between Shipman's home visits and his patients' deaths. All these doctors were found not guilty. In October 2005, a similar hearing was held against two doctors who worked at Tameside General Hospital in 1994, who failed to detect that Shipman had deliberately administered a "grossly excessive" dose of [[morphine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4305366.stm|title=Shipman doctors deny misconduct|work=BBC News|date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4331208.stm|title=Shipman doctor 'not good enough'|date=11 October 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shipman Inquiry recommended changes to the structure of the General Medical Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4081425.stm |title=Shipman report demands GMC reform |date=9 December 2004|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, it came to light that Shipman may have stolen jewellery from his victims. In 1998, police had seized over £10,000 worth of jewellery they found in his garage. In March 2005, when Primrose Shipman asked for its return, police wrote to the families of Shipman's victims asking them to identify the jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4357193.stm|title=Theft fears over 'Shipman gems'|work=BBC News|date=17 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4446593.stm|title=Twenty make Shipman jewels claims|work=BBC News|date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/aug/31/shipman.uknews|title=Shipman's stolen gems found in his wife's jewellery box|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 August 2005|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unidentified items were handed to the [[Assets Recovery Agency]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4574147.stm|title=Shipman jewels not going to widow|work=BBC News|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation ended in August. Authorities returned 66 pieces to Primrose Shipman and auctioned 33 pieces that she confirmed were not hers. Proceeds of the auction went to Tameside Victim Support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4197812.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman stole victim's jewellery|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/shipman/Story/0,,1559544,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Shipman's stolen gems found in his wife's jewellery box|date=31 August 2005 | location=London | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only piece returned to a murdered patient's family was a platinum diamond ring, for which the family provided a photograph as proof of ownership.

A memorial garden to Shipman's victims, called the Garden of Tranquillity, opened in Hyde Park, [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] on 30 July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4731119.stm |title=Garden tribute to Shipman victims |date=30 July 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2009, families of over 200 of the victims of Shipman were still seeking compensation for the loss of their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alexanderharris.co.uk/article/Nurse_convicted_of_murder_of_two_patients_by_lethal_injection_2588.asp |title=Alexander Harris, the law firm who represented families of victims of Allitt and Shipman |date=25 August 2006 |publisher=Alexander Harris |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930061847/http://alexanderharris.co.uk/article/Nurse_convicted_of_murder_of_two_patients_by_lethal_injection_2588.asp |archivedate=30 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, authorities announced that letters Shipman wrote in prison would be sold at auction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Shipman effect===
The Shipman case, and a series of recommendations in the Shipman Inquiry report, led to changes to standard medical procedures in Britain (now referred to as the "Shipman effect"). Many doctors reported changes in their dispensing practices, and a reluctance to risk over-prescribing pain medication may have led to under-prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5252902.stm|title='Shipman effect' harms pain care|last=|first=|date=7 August 2006|work=|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=BBC|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30192721|title=Shipman effect: How a serial killer changed medical practice forever|last=Queiro|first=Alicia|date=1 December 2014|website=BBC|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death certification practices were altered as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation Paper on Death Certification, Burial and Cremation|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/26131024/4|website=Scottish Government|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest change was the movement from single-doctor general practices to multiple-doctor general practices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} This was not a direct recommendation, but rather because the report stated that there was not enough safeguarding and monitoring of doctors' decisions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The forms needed for a cremation in England and Wales have had their questions altered as a direct result of the Shipman case. For example, the person(s) organising the funeral must answer, 'Do you know or suspect that the death of the person who has died was violent or unnatural?  Do you consider that there should be any further examination of the remains of the person who has died?&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697075/cremation-form-1-app-for-cremation-of-body.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
''Harold and Fred (They Make Ladies Dead)'' was a 2001 strip cartoon in ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'', also featuring serial killer [[Fred West]]. Some relatives of Shipman's victims voiced anger at the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/viz-pushes-taste-to-its-limits-with-shipman-cartoon-705190.html |title='Viz' pushes taste to its limits with Shipman cartoon |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1 February 2001 |accessdate=6 March 2009 |last=Garrett |first=Jade |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223083641/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/viz-pushes-taste-to-its-limits-with-shipman-cartoon-705190.html |archivedate=23 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1148180.stm

''[[Harold Shipman: Doctor Death]]'', an [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] television dramatisation of the case, was made in 2002; it starred [[James Bolam]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306943 |title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death | medium=Television drama |year=2002 |people=Roger Bamford (Director)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was referenced in an episode of the 2003 [[CBS]] television [[medical drama]] series ''Diagnosis: Unknown'' called "Deadly Medicine" (Season 2, Episode 17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0559329| title=Diagnosis: Unknown: Deadly Medicine | medium=Television series |year=2003| people=Greg Francis (Director)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as Jack Halford in the [[BBC One]] television series ''[[New Tricks]]'' during the 2010 episode "Where There's Smoke", James Bolam mentions Shipman in a lecture on serial killers. The British sitcom ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'' made use of the surnames of known English [[serial killers]] including Shipman for some of the main characters.&lt;ref name="independent surname"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html | title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin &amp; Stacey |date=21 November 2009 |work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary also titled ''Harold Shipman: Doctor Death'', with new witness testimony about the serial killer, was shown by [[ITV_(TV_channel)|ITV]] as part of its ''Crime &amp; Punishment'' strand on 26 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week17/harold-shipman-doctor-death|title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death|accessdate=17 April 2018|publisher=ITV Press Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was criticised as offering "little new insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2018/04/26/harold-shipman-doctor-death-review-20-years-documentary-offered/|title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death, review: 20 years on, this documentary offered little new insight|first=Gerard|last=O'Donovan|date=26 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] refer to Shipman in their song "What About Us?" on the 2005 album ''[[Fall Heads Roll]]''. The lyrics of the song mention a "doctor giving out morphine" and the chorus includes singer [[Mark E. Smith]] and backing singers chanting in call and response, "What about us? (Shipman!)"

The [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (season 3)|third season ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'']] episode "D.A.W." was based on the Shipman murder case.

A play titled ''Beyond Belief - Scenes From the Shipman Inquiry'', written by Dennis Woolf and directed by Chris Honer was performed at the Library Theatre, Manchester, 20 October – 22 November 2004. The script of the play comprised edited verbatim extracts from [[The Shipman Inquiry]], spoken by actors playing the witnesses and lawyers at the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/theatre-news/play-exposes-legacy-of-shipman-horror-1126194|title=Play exposes legacy of Shipman horror|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=22 October 2004|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided a "stark narrative" that focused on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rushforth|first=Bruno|date=4 November 2004|title=Beyond Belief: Scenes from the Shipman Inquiry|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/329/7474/1109|journal=BMJ|volume=329|issue=7474|pages=1109|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7474.1109|pmc=526136|issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amelia Sach and Annie Walters 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Amelia Sach and Annie Walters in the dock in 1903]]
'''Amelia Sach''' (1873 – 3 February 1903) and '''Annie Walters''' (1869 – 3 February 1903) were two [[United Kingdom|British]] murderers better known as ''the [[Finchley]] [[baby-farming|baby farmers]]''.

==Crimes==
Amelia Sach operated a "[[lying-in]]" home in Stanley Road, and later at Claymore House in Hertford Road (both in [[East Finchley]]), [[London]]. Around 1900,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 121]&lt;/ref&gt; she began to advertise that babies "could be left", and took money for adoptions. The clients, judging from the witness accounts, were mostly servants from local houses who had become pregnant, and who had employers who were keen for the matter to be resolved discreetly. There was a charge for [[lying-in]], and another for adoption, a "present" to future parents of between £25 and £30.

Annie Walters would collect the baby after it was born, and then dispose of the child with a poisonous mixture—[[chlorodyne]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 123]&lt;/ref&gt; (a medicine containing [[morphine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caversham.otago.ac.nz/resource/biographies/emmelineThomasGalloway.html|title=The Caversham Project : University of Otago|first=History|last=Department|website=caversham.otago.ac.nz|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
[[File:Execution of Sach and Walters 1903.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The double execution of Sach and Walters at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]]]]
They were caught after Walters raised the suspicions of her landlord in [[Islington]] who was a police officer. An unknown number of babies were murdered this way, although the figure is considered to be in excess of a dozen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.executedtoday.com/2017/02/03/1903-amelia-sach-and-annie-walters-the-finchley-baby-farmers/ ''executedtoday.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women Serial and Mass Murderers: A Worldwide Reference: 1580-1990'' {{ISBN|978-0-899-50680-7}} p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; During their trial at the [[Old Bailey]], the quantity of baby clothes found at Claymore House was used as evidence to indicate the sheer scale of their crimes. A local campaign to have their sentences commuted to life failed, and they became the first women to be [[hanged]] at [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]] on 3 February 1903, by [[William Billington]], in what was the only double hanging of women to be carried out in modern times.

==Background==
Little is known about Annie Walters, but Sach's background is well-documented: Amelia Sach was baptised Frances Amelia Thorne in [[Hampreston]], Dorset, on 5 May 1867. She was the fourth child of ten and had three sisters. She married a builder called Jeffrey Sach in 1896. Sach was active long before she engaged Walters. By 1902 she was working from 'Claymore House', a semi-detached, red-brick villa in East Finchley, North London.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1394309/Baby-killer-Amelia-Sach-Penninah-Ashers-family-Researching-background-popular--past-hide-horrific-secrets.html|title=The baby killer in my family: Researching your background has never been so popular...but the past can hide horrific secrets|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sach was herself a mother; the England and Wales census of 1901 shows that a child was born to her in [[Clapham]]. She lied about her age – she was 32, not 29. Walters' background is unknown, but she had been married. She seems to have had a drinking problem and she would periodically advertise herself as a sick nurse. On her arrest she was determined to be "feeble", that is to say, feeble-minded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small possibility that the pair may have been involved in an earlier homicide that resulted in another woman being executed.  In 1899, [[Louise Masset]] was tried for the murder of her young son Manfred, whose body was found in the ladies' lavatory at [[Dalston Junction railway station]]. [[Circumstantial evidence]] suggested that Louise was the murderer, and the killing was to be rid of a supposed encumbrance due to her wanting to marry a man named Lucas.  However, in her claims of innocence, Louise said she had taken Manfred out of the care of one woman to give him to two ladies she met who had an establishment for the care of growing children.  The police claimed they made some effort in looking for the two women, but the extent of their investigation is unknown.  In any event, Louise Masset was tried and convicted of the murder and, despite a petition for mercy, was executed on 9 January 1900.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Amelia Sach Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Tombstone showing the name of Amelia Sach]]
[[File:Annie Walters Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Tombstone showing the name of Annie Walters]]
The bodies of Sach and Walters were buried in [[unmarked grave]]s within the walls of Holloway Prison, as was customary. In 1971 the prison underwent an extensive programme of rebuilding, during which the bodies of all the executed women were exhumed. With the exception of [[Ruth Ellis]], the remains of the four other women executed at Holloway (i.e. [[Styllou Christofi]], [[Edith Thompson]], Sach and Walters) were subsequently reburied in a single grave (plot 117) at [[Brookwood Cemetery]]. The grave is marked with a horizontally laid grey granite tombstone, and the names of all the occupants are engraved on it. The precise location of Sach and Walters' grave within Brookwood Cemetery is {{coord|51|18|13.67|N|0|37|33.33|W|region:GB_scale:1000|display=inline}}. The remains of Thompson were exhumed in 2018 and laid to rest in the grave of her mother and father in the [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium|City of London Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Lusher, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/edith-thompson-death-penalty-capital-punishment-hanging-miscarriage-justice-buried-mother-murder-a8647636.html Lsid to rest at last: Edith Thompson, victim of a 'barbarous, misogynistic death penalty' - ''[[The Independent]]'' 22 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Claymore House", the semi-detached, red-brick villa where Sach had lived and worked in 1902 acquired a bad reputation due to the criminal activities which took place there. Some time after the trial of Sach and Walters, the building had its name chiselled off the stone plaque above the window and is now anonymous.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of [[Nicola Upson]]'s novel ''Two for Sorrow'' (2010, Faber &amp; Faber, London; Harper, New York) revolves around the aftermath of the Finchley Baby Farming affair.  Both Sach and Walters appear as characters.

'''Margarita Sánchez Gutiérrez''' (born December 26, 1953 in [[Málaga]]), also known as the "Black Widow of [[Barcelona]]" and "The Black Widow of Hospitalet", was a [[Spain|Spanish]] serial killer who received her name for her method of murder - by poisoning the food and drinks she offered her victims. She managed to kill four people and poisoned three others who managed to survive. All of the victims were close to her, including family members and neighbours.

== Biography ==
When she moved to [[Catalonia]] she first lived in [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]], on Riera Blanca Street, where she was known as "la bizca". This was a modest neighbourhood of workers, where she was considered a troubled woman, but without a criminal record. According to neighbours, she was prone to insults and street fights, and had debts in some shops in the area; she was greedy and seemingly illiterate according to what she declared to police. In 1991 Margarita moved with her husband, Luis Navarro, and their children Sonia and Javi to their in-laws' floor, partly because they had been discouraged but also to take care of her husband's father. Margarita and Carmen Nuez, her mother-in-law, did not get along because apparently the latter was a woman of authority and great character. In 1992, the father-in-law died and Carmen was hospitalized five times in the Clinical Hospital where she proclaimed her daughter-in-law is poisoning her. However, the performing analyzers gave a negative results. Currently, since 2016 she lives in the La Maurina neighbourhood of [[Terrassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/buzon/nicho/abierto/elpepiopi/19960801elpepiopi_1/Tes|title=Un buzón como un nicho abierto|publisher=ELPAÍS.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentence ==
Margarita Sánchez Gutiérrez was sentenced to 34 years in prison for three crimes of injury, another three for robbery with violence and one crime for falsehood. She was acquitted of the murders when no cases of death due to cyanide were detected and because Margarita's intention was to drug and rob her relatives, not to kill them, according to the justice.

'''Abdelkader Salhi M.''' (born 1969), known as the '''10 Killer''', is a suspected [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]] who murdered at least three prostitutes in [[Spain]] between August and September 2011. He is currently awaiting sentencing.&lt;ref name=victim&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/malaga/20150602/sevi-victimas-invisibles-salhi-201506012013.html|title=The invisible victims of Salhi|author=Pablo D. Almoguera|publisher=[[ABC News|ABC News Sevilla]]|date=6 February 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and move to Spain==
A native of Wiesbaden, Germany, Salhi was born to a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] father and a German mother. He developed a deep disgust towards prostitutes from a young age, since his mother's extramarital activities resulted in the separation of his parents.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt; In 1988, while trying to rob a woman, Salhi killed her, which landed him an 18 year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=double&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.surinenglish.com/20111009/news/costasol-malaga/double-costa-killer-already-201110091819.html|title=Double Costa killer had already been convicted of murder in Germany|author=Juan Cano|publisher=Surinenglish.com|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Salhi illegally moved to Spain in 2007 under another identity, settling in a residence at Fontana Beach, Riviera del Sol.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; According to his Moroccan girlfriend, Sara Er Rezyni, he was constantly jealous when it came to his privacy and constantly avoided contradicting himself.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt; He also held four forged passports (including Irish, French and Italian) and spoke four languages.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2011/09/29/costa-del-sol-serial-killer-arrested/#.XLCrBDAzbIV|title='Costa del Sol Serial Killer' arrested|publisher=[[EuroWeekly News]]|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
According to investigating authorities, Salhi contacted his victims through telephone after seeing their adverts in a local English-language newspaper. In order to gain their trust, he first visited them several times, having casual sex with them. After killing the women, he would steal their mobile phones, cash and credit cards, with his girlfriend later withdrawing 1,000 euros from the first two victims' bank accounts.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; Sara's mother was later found out to be in possession of one of the phones.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;

===Susana Monterroso===
Originally from [[Argentina]] but with Spanish nationality, the 45-year-old Monterroso was killed in her rented apartment at the Complejo Alhamar in Calahonda on August 10, 2011. She had been stabbed 17 times, with a pillowcase later being tied around her neck and a pillow put on her head. Her son found her body the following morning.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

===Brigitte SR===
The 49-year-old German prostitute was found dead by police at her Calahonda apartment on September 2, although it was estimated that she had died a week before. At the time of discovery, the corpse was at an advanced stage of decomposition, but police managed to find that Salhi's number was the last one the victim had called before her death.

===Maryuri Alice Pérez García===
The 47-year-old [[Ecuador]]ian-born Pérez was killed at her shared apartment in San Pedro de Alcantara on September 10. She had been stabbed 13 times and then robbed of her phone, credit card and 100 euros.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; It was noted that in this instance, the killer had taken the knife with him, but after the murder, had cleaned it up before leaving it at a kitchen drawer in Pérez's house.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Detectives working on both cases began developing a theory that the murders were committed by the same person, backed up by the fact that the victims were supposedly chosen because they were vulnerable women who received their clients in rented flats. Through examination of phone records, they received another clue to the killer's identity, but the discovery came after 2,000 euros were withdrawn from one of the women's bank accounts.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;

Authorities later arrested Salhi while he was working out in a local gym under the assumed name of Martin Sparitt. During the subsequent five hour investigation, he confessed to the Costa del Sol murders, providing great detail in both instances.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; Brigitte SR's case was later connected to the series, and he is currently being investigated for possible other murders around Spain.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

Despite the evidence presented, Salhi later recanted his confessions, claiming that the arresting officers had threatened and beaten him into signing the confessions. However, Rezyni admitted during questioning that on the day of one the murders, she had seen wounds on Abdelkader. Currently, his trial continues, and if convicted, Salhi could face up to 63 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;

'''Moses Sithole ''' (born 17 November 1964) is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]] who committed the '''ABC Murders''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm|title=Worst criminals of SA|last=Kendal|first=Rebekah|date=3 May 2007|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=3 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084655/http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm|archive-date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; so named because they began in [[Atteridgeville]], continued in [[Boksburg, Gauteng|Boksburg]] and finished in [[Cleveland, Gauteng|Cleveland]], a [[suburb]] of [[Johannesburg]]. Sithole murdered at least 38 people between 16 July 1994 and 6 November 1995.

==Early life==
Moses Sithole was born on 17 November 1964 in [[Vosloorus]], a township near [[Boksburg]], [[Transvaal Province]] (now known as [[Gauteng]]). When he was five years old, his father died, and his mother abandoned the family.&lt;ref name="Greig2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/176 176]|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sithole and his siblings spent the next three years in an [[Orphanage#South_Africa|orphanage]], where he later said they were mistreated. By his own account, Sithole was arrested for [[rape]] in his teens and spent seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt; He later blamed his imprisonment for turning him into a murderer. He explained his crimes by saying that the women he murdered all reminded him of the women who had falsely accused him of rape years before.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

==Murders==
Sithole appeared to be a mild-mannered individual to those around him. At the time of his crimes, he was managing a [[shell organization]], Youth Against Human Abuse, ostensibly devoted to the eradication of [[child abuse]]. After committing murders in Atteridgeville, near [[Pretoria]], Sithole moved his focus to Boksburg and eventually to [[Cleveland, Gauteng|Cleveland]]. By 1995, he had claimed over thirty victims, sparking nationwide panic. In some cases, he would later phone the victims' families for no other apparent reason than to taunt them.&lt;ref&gt;[[A&amp;E Biography]] - Moses Sithole&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] visited Boksburg in person to appeal for public assistance in apprehending the killer.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

===Methods===
Sithole targeted black women between the ages of 18 and 45 years old. Most of his victims were being interviewed for positions with Sithole's [[ersatz]] charity. Sithole would take them to remote fields, where he would beat, rape, and murder them. They were generally [[strangulation|strangled]] with their own underwear. He once inflicted a head wound on the two-year-old son of one of his victims and left him to die from exposure.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

==Capture==
In August 1995, Sithole was identified as having been seen with one of the victims, but he disappeared shortly after [[South African Police Service|SAPS]] investigators learned details of his previous rape conviction. In October 1995, Sithole contacted South African journalist Tamsen de Beer and identified himself as the wanted murderer.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt; During a phone conversation with de Beer, he indicated that the killings were carried out in revenge for his unjust imprisonment and claimed 76 victims, twice as many as those reported. Finally, in order to prove his identity, Sithole gave directions to where one of the bodies had been left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/177 177]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities subsequently cornered Sithole in [[Johannesburg]], shooting the suspect when he attacked a constable with a [[hatchet]]. Sithole was driven to the hospital, where he was found to be [[HIV]] positive.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= South African Strangler: Moses Sithole|url=http://www.biography.com/tv/notorious/episodes/south-african-strangler|series= Notorious|network= The Biography Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
On 5 December 1997, Sithole was sentenced to fifty years' imprisonment for each of the thirty-eight murders, twelve years' imprisonment for each of the forty rapes, and five years' imprisonment for each of six [[robbery|robberies]]. Since his [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] run consecutively, the total effective sentence is one of 2,410 years. Justice David Carstairs ordered that Sithole would be required to serve at least 930 years before being eligible for [[parole]]. The judge also told Sithole that had [[capital punishment]] [[Capital punishment in South Africa|not been abolished]], he would have been sentenced to death. Sithole was incarcerated in [[C Max|C-Max]], the maximum security section of [[Pretoria]] Central Prison. He is currently incarcerated in Mangaung Correctional Centre in [[Bloemfontein]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}

'''Norman Avzal Simons''' (born 12 January 1967), also known as the "'''Station Strangler,'''" is a [[South Africa]]n [[rape|rapist]] and [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 1995 of the rape and murder of 10-year-old Elroy van Rooy. He was sentenced to 35 years (25 for murder and 10 for kidnapping) in prison.&lt;ref name="sstrangler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Candice|title=Revisiting the Station Strangler cases|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/revisiting-the-station-strangler-cases-1.250970|accessdate=16 December 2015|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=16 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Simons was an intelligent individual who enjoyed playing classical music and was capable of speaking seven languages including English, [[Afrikaans]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="teacher"&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/S/SIMONS_norman_afzal.php. Serial Killer Crime Index.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was employed as a Grade Five teacher at Alpine Primary School in Beacon Valley, [[Mitchell's Plain]].&lt;ref name=sstrangler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitaker|first1=Raymond|title=Coloured teacher charged in 'Cape Strangler' murder|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/coloured-teacher-charged-in-cape-strangler-murder-1371008.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=19 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons' victims were all young boys aged between 9 and 13.&lt;ref name="victims"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm |title=iAfrica : ''Worst Criminals of South Africa.'' |access-date=6 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141639/http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons and his victims were from the [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Man Who Killed Boy S. Africa's Serial Strangler?|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/422660/IS-MAN-WHO-KILLED-BOY-S-AFRICAS-SERIAL-STRANGLER.html?pg=all|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=14 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simons is believed to have started his sporadic series of murders in 29 October 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iol.co.za/news/station-strangler-up-for-parole-1687793 ''Station Strangler up for Parole'']&lt;/ref&gt; ending only with his arrest nine years later in April 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect held in 21 killings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19940711&amp;id=ZTQdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jaUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2361,3122136&amp;hl=en|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=11 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected his moniker after it became apparent that most of his victims were lured away from train stations (Soviet serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]] had a similar ''modus operandi'').

Simons raped and sodomised his victims before strangling them. Victims were found face down with their hands tied behind their backs, buried in shallow sandy graves. In some cases the victims were found with their underwear around their necks, presumably used as a garrote. Hand-written notes were also found next to some victims.&lt;ref name="victims"/&gt; Simons' relationship with his older stepbrother seems to have a major bearing on his criminal activities. Simons alleges that his older stepbrother raped and sodomised him as a child. He also reports 'hearing voices' from his brother instructing him to kill. Simons' brother, an alcoholic, was murdered in 1991.

Simons appeared before magistrates in 1995 on one charge of murder and kidnap. His trial lasted three months, leading to a conviction and life sentence. He is currently serving his sentence in [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre|Drakenstein Maximum Correctional Facility]], [[Paarl]]. Simons appealed against his conviction in 1998, but his conviction was upheld.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 2005, an inquest was opened into the deaths of the remaining victims. After three years of further analysis, the victims' parents came no closer to an answer. On 9 December 2008, Regional Magistrate Marelize Rolle stated that she believed ''prima facie'' evidence showed Simons was probably responsible for the deaths of at least six of the other victims. However, due to the amount of time that had passed, she ruled out further prosecutions in the case.&lt;ref name="prosecution"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200812100149.html Cape Argus : ''No further prosecutions for Simons.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Simons converted to Islam in 1993, taking on the name Avzal, but converted back to Christianity in 1994.&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;Pistorious, M. 2005. ''Profiling Serial Killers and other crimes in South Africa''. Penguin Books, South Africa. page 170. {{ISBN|0-14-302482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Sidyno''' is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 2000 of 7 murders and sentenced to 7 [[Life Sentence]]s in prison.&lt;ref name="Sentence"&gt;[http://www.sundaytribune.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=159&amp;fArticleId=qw968152741272B263. ‘‘Sunday Tribune’’ : Sadistic Serial Killer gets seven life terms.]&lt;/ref&gt; His victims all came from the [[Pretoria]] area of [[Gauteng]].

Sidyno undertook a murderous rampage starting November 1998 and culminating with his arrest on 6 January 1999. He killed and disposed of his victims in the Capital Park hills of [[Pretoria]], a deserted area of hills near the city centre and [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa|Pretoria Zoo]].

== Victims ==
His victims included two adult women; Paulinah Ledwaba and Elizabeth Senwamadi. He also killed five youths, only two of whom could be identified; Ronald Maoka and Emmanuel Mavuka. Sidyno assaulted and strangled his victims before re-clothing them and covering their bodies with brush. He was noted for removing his victims shoes and placing them neatly next to their bodies.&lt;ref name="Conviction"&gt;[http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=672&amp;fArticleId=qw967653421636B263. ‘‘Pretoria News’’ : Pretoria Serial Killer convicted of 7 murders.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convictions ==
On 30 August 2000, Sidyno was convicted of the seven murders. He was sentenced by Judge Johan van der Westhuizen on 5 September 2000 to seven life terms with a recommended 40 years in jail before he could be paroled. The judge said an expert on [[serial killer]]s had described Sidyno as a [[psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] sexual [[murder]]er, adding that Sidyno could therefore not be rehabilitated.&lt;ref name="Sentence"/&gt;

'''Khangayi Sedumedi''' (born '''Kangai Sedumedi''', 1977, in [[Gugulethu]], [[Western Cape]]), also known as '''The Century City Killer''', is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] and rapist, responsible for the murders of between four to six women in the aforementioned [[Cape Town]] neighborhood between 2011 and 2015.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/century-city-killers-modus-operandi-revealed-2032665|title=Century City killer's modus operandi revealed|author=Catherine Rice|publisher=IOL|date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted on four counts and given seven life sentences in 2016, and is currently incarcerated at an unnamed prison in Cape Town.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.npa.gov.za/sites/default/files/media-releases/2016%20June%2013%20-%20Serial%20Rapist%20And%20Murderer%20Sentenced%20To%207%20Life%20Sentences%20Plus%2040%20Years.pdf|title=Serial Rapist and Murdered Sentenced to 7 Life Sentences Plus 40 Years|author=Eric Ntabazalia|publisher=[[National Prosecuting Authority]]|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Born as the only child of [[Shona people|Shona]] man Adam Wapaka and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] Jacqueline Sedumedi, he was named Kangai at birth, but Xhosa relatives from the family pronounced it as Khangayi.&lt;ref name=good&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/century-city-killer-was-my-good-pal-2033655|title=Century City killer was my good pal|author=Roland Thabo Mpofu|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his grandmother, who had him regularly attend services at the local church, along with his aunt and cousins. Khangayi was given the nickname "Jesus" by childhood friends, as he never got angry at anybody no matter the circumstances, and always avoided fighting with other youths.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;

In 1990, Sedumedi's mother Jacqueline disappeared suddenly, with her whereabouts still unknown.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; This took a great toll on the young Khangayi, who became a shy loner who avoided having his picture taken, to the point where even his own family didn't have any photographs of him. Even stranger, in the years prior to his arrest, he would disappear mysteriously for weeks on end, only to later return saying that he was "just around". In 2012, he vanished for almost a year before suddenly resurfacing in 2013, claiming he had been in [[France]].&lt;ref name=good/&gt;

Despite his odd behavior and frequent vanishings, Sedumedi was regarded as a hard worker and an ambitious person, with a passion for the [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]]. In 2003, he quickly befriended Roland Thabo Mpofu, whom Khangayi treated as a brother and referred to by the nickname "TaTibo". Mpofu, whom later married one of Sedumedi's cousins, noted in a later interview that Khangayi always spoke highly of his all-female cousins and was never visibly violent to women. However, he and the family alike were puzzled by the fact that he had never spoken of a girlfriend or even a female friend.&lt;ref name=good/&gt; Before his arrest, he was working as a security guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2016/06/10/NPA-satisfied-with-sentencing-of-CT-serial-rapist|title=NPA satisfied with sentencing of CT serial rapist|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=Eyewitness News|date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Murders, trial and imprisonment==
In the period between November 2011 and January 2015, a series of violent crimes against women occurred in the Cape Town suburbs of [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]] and [[Kensington, Cape Town|Kensington]], mostly centered around the train station in Century City. A total of eight victims were raped, with six of them being murdered by their attacker: the youngest being a 15-year-old, who was raped both vaginally and anally, and sustained multiple injuries during her assault. The bodies of the deceased were discovered in a field near Acre Road between February and December 2014, all of them naked and with their hands tied behind their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2015/09/18/Alleged-Century-City-Killer-case-to-be-heard-in-high-court|title='Century City Killer' case transferred to WC High Court|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=[[Eyewitness News (South Africa)|Eyewitness News]]|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to catch the perpetrator and calm down the frightened community, Cape Town Mayor [[Patricia de Lille]] offered a reward of 50,000 [[South African rand|rands]] to anybody who could help capture the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2015/01/09/Man-arrested-for-Kensington-serial-killings|title=Man arrested for Kensington serial killings|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=Eyewitness News|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2015, Sedumedi was taken in for questioning regarding the crimes. Before long, he was charged with 23 counts, including eight rapes, four murders, two kidnappings, five robberies with aggravating circumstances, attempted robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted rape and assault, all before the Goodwood Magistrates Court. He entered into a plea deal and confessed his guilt to all but two of the charges.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; While in court, he explained his [[modus operandi]]: selecting his victims, mostly young jobseekers, at random, he approached the women under the pretext of possible job opportunities.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; He obtained their contact details, and would later phone the victim, claiming to have secured them a job interview. Agreeing to meet on a specific date, he would ambush the victim in an isolated place, where he would rape, rob and kill them. In some instances, he used a plastic toy gun to force them into submission.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; He also confessed to murdering the women so they could not identify him later on.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Taking into account all the charges against him, Justice John Hlope gave him seven life sentences, as well as an additional 40 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

'''Jozef Slovák''' (born 1951) is a [[Slovak people|Slovak]] [[serial killer]] who murdered at least five women in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] from 1978 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluska.sk/slovensko/vrah-genius.html|title=Vrah génius!|language=Slovak|work=www.pluska.sk|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving a life sentence for four murders in [[Ilava]] Prison in [[Slovakia]].

Slovák remains one of the most significant participants in the controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aktualne.centrum.sk/domov/kauzy/clanek.phtml?id=1148375|title=Psychopat chcel sex s matkou obete|language=Slovak|work=Aktuálne.sk|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wide-ranging [[amnesty]] of the newly elected President of [[Czechoslovakia]] [[Václav Havel]]. Because of this amnesty, Slovák served only eight years in prison for the murder of a 21-year-old Yugoslavian woman, and after his release, murdered at least four other young women in less than a year and a half before again being captured. Jozef Slovák remains one of only two people convicted of a series of murders without any ties to [[organized crime]] in the modern [[history of Slovakia]] (the other being [[Ondrej Rigo]]).

== Early life ==
Little is known about Slovák's early life. He was born in [[Plavecký Štvrtok]], [[Slovakia]] on April 7, 1951. Altogether, he was sentenced to prison eight times during his life.

== Murders ==
Jozef Slovák was convicted of the murder of five women, listed below.

Jozef Slovák met his first victim, [[Yugoslavia]]n woman Blažica P. on a train. On August 22, 1978, he took her into the woods in [[Bratislava]], Železná studnička (today part of [[Bratislava Forest Park]]) and tried to have sex with her. As she refused and tried to fight back, he choked her to death. After the murder, he dragged her body deeper into the forest and covered it with branches. After burning some of Blažica P.'s clothing right there in the forest, he gave some of the things she had on her body to his girlfriend.

In 1982, Slovák was sentenced to 15 years in prison for this first murder. He started to serve his sentence in [[Leopoldov Prison]] but was released on probation March 10, 1990 because of a wide-ranging amnesty by president of Czechoslovakia [[Václav Havel]]. Almost two-thirds of Czechoslovak criminals at that time were released from prison practically at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aktualne.atlas.sk/rekorderom-v-udelovani-milosti-bol-prezident-kovac/slovensko/politika/|title=Rekordérom v udeľovaní milostí bol prezident Kováč|language=Slovak|work=Aktuálne.sk|date=4 April 2009|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many murderers, career criminals and other dangerous people were released from prisons on probation or parole. Without the amnesty, Slovák would not have been released until 1997. From 1990 to 1991, Slovák murdered at least four women, committing his second murder just four months after being released from prison.

He met his second victim, Monika Ondíková (from [[Moldava nad Bodvou]], [[Slovakia]]), in [[Prague]]. On July 4, 1990, he left the capital with her for [[Konopiště]], near [[Benešov]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of Prague. In the manor park, Jozef Slovák shot her 8 times from his [[Gas pistol|gas gun]], using neuroparalytic gas. Then, he hit her in the head several times with a stick, killing her. He searched the body, finding and stealing US$2,400, 800 German marks, over 16,000 Austrian schillings, a ring and her makeup. Again, he dragged the body deeper into the nearby forest and covered it with branches. Slovák returned to her body a week later to put a railway ticket to [[České Budějovice]] into her pocket, trying to confuse the police.

Two days after his last murder, Slovák was arrested in [[Bratislava]]. Bruises were found on his body caused by Anna Královičová's. The police also found an illegal firearm.

On August 20, 1993, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the City Court of [[Bratislava]] for the murders of Monika Ondíková, Vladislava Maříková, Diana Lopuchovská and Anna Královičová.

In 1997, Slovák complained to [[Ilava]] city representatives that he was unable to create any new inventions in his field of electronics, mainly because of the lack of tools not having access to a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/ilava/galeriaobrazovnao873354240.phtml |title=Galéria obrazov na oddelení výnimočných trestov |language=sk |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143735/http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/ilava/galeriaobrazovnao873354240.phtml |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation and arrest ==
The initial suspect was a man named Kazimierz P., who served 19 months in prison. On the trail of Sowiński, the police had already fallen off in September 1997. He was a conscript soldier in the [[Nadwślańskie units of the Ministry of Interior and Administration]] in [[Sanok]]. During the interrogations, without any embarrassment or emotions, he confessed to the crimes. This, combined with other evidence gathered, was enough to prosecute him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.e-reporter.pl/index.php/component/k2/item/86-pokuta-potwora|title=The repentance of a monster|publisher=e-reporter.pl|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and sentence ==
The trial began in autumn 1998 in [[Zamość]] and from the very beginning was accompanied by great emotions. In October, during the first trial, the father of Wiesława Ł., one of Sowiński's victims, attacked him with an axe smuggled to court, wounding him in the back. Sowiński went to the hospital and the attacker was detained. However, thanks to the intercession of the voivodes of Zamość and the protests of his neighbors, he was released. After he recovered, his case was resumed. The prosecutor's office him of quadruple murder and rape. To emphasize how dangerous and deranged he was, the prosecutor cited that after one of the killings he killed the owner's cows and then began to interact sexually with their corpses. The accused himself refused to give explanations, he only said he was innocent. His advocate tried to prove that Sowiński can not be convicted because he is [[mentally ill]] is. 20 experts in the field of psychology and [[sexology]] were appointed in his case. Everyone clearly stated that he was fully sane, and his deviations could be even deeper. The prosecutor's office demanded the penalty of life imprisonment with the possibility of conditional release after 50 years. In 2000, the District Court of Zamość sentenced him to the highest penalty. The Court of Appeal in [[Lublin]] also upheld it on the grounds that Sowiński posed a threat to the environment. A year later, as a result of the cassation of Sowiński, the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] quashed the verdict and remitted it for re-examination. In 2002, the District Court of Zamość imposed on him a life imprisonment with the possibility of conditional release after serving 50 years of imprisonment. In 2003, the Court of Appeal in Lublin finally upheld the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.dziennikwschodni.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100416/LUBLIN/137450076|title=The serial killer "vampire" will not get half a million zlotys in damages|author=er|publisher=dziennikwschodni.pl|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment ==
Sowiński is serving a sentence in the [[Rzeszów-Załęże Criminal Facility]], in an one-person cell in the therapeutic ward. He repeatedly sued in court during the sanction: against the father of one of his victims, who attacked him with an axe when he was led to the courtroom, from whom he demanded PLN 13,000 for "moral damage and losses"; against two policemen who escorted him - demanded PLN 80,000 for "not providing him with adequate protection", and PLN 360 for "damaged clothing", in another case - against the District Prosecutor of Zamość, from whom he demanded PLN 500,000 in compensation for "the prosecutor being rude and did not allow him to get acquainted with the case file", and Sowiński brought the last action in 2010 against [[Radio Lublin]]. For using the term "vampire", he demanded compensation from the radio in the amount of PLN 500,000. All actions brought by Sowiński were validly dismissed.

While serving the penalty, he completed a journeyman's course in the profession of a basket-maker.

Since 2004, he has consistently sought a pardon from successive presidents of Poland: [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[Lech Kaczyński]], and more recently (in 2011) - [[Bronisław Komorowski]]. So far, all the requests, due to the negative criminological prognosis (progressive progression of sexual dysfunction) have been treated negatively at the judicial stage, and thus left without further progress.

Mariusz Sowiński will be apply for conditional early release in early 2047, at the age of 71.

'''Michel Stockx''' (born in [[Lochristi]] in 1942 - died in [[Beverwijk]] on 25 September 2001) was a [[Belgian]] serial killer who worked as a truck driver in [[Assen]].

On 27 July 1991, he lured 11-year-old Jessica Laven from [[Blokker, Netherlands|Blokker]] out a swimming pool in [[Zwaag]]. Later she was found strangled in [[Bad Nieuweschans]]. During his interrogation, Stockx also confessed to abusing and murdering two [[Germany|German]] boys, 13-year-old Marco Weisser from [[Wiesbaden]] and 10-year-old Salim Thattil from [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]].

There are also persistent rumours that Stockx is responsible for the death of 10-year-old Belgian girl Nathalie Geijsbregts. Sjaak H., a member of the Venlo Gang, claimed that Stockx would have told him if that were true. He was also questioned as a suspect in the murder of Cheryl Morriën from [[IJmuiden]] but he denied any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010691693:mpeg21:a1384|title=How the killer of Jessica Laven and two German boys was exposed|author=Cees Koring|publisher=De Telegraaf|date=11 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, his name is mentioned in connection to the murder of 10-year-old Anaïs Marcelli in [[Mulhouse]] in [[France]].

For the murders of Laven, Weisser and Thattil, Michel Stockx was sentenced to 20 years in prison in November 1992 and he was detained in the [[Scheveningen]] Penitentiary. A few months before his death there was a stir in the Netherlands when it turned out that he received a disability benefit in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.misdaadjournalist.nl/rapportages/michelstockxendedodekinderen.html|title='Michel Stockx and the dead children'|publisher=misdaadjournalist.nl|author=Hendrik Jan Korterink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2001, during his work therapy, he knocked over a bottle of turpentine and banged a fluorescent tube, causing a fire. More than 60% of his body was burned severely and he was transported to the [[burn center]] in [[Beverwijk]]. He died there on September 25. The parents of Jessica Laven were pleased with the news. According to the police, it was an accident, but the media speculated it was an assassination attempt or suicide. However, the authorities refuted these claims.

'''Alexander Ivanovich Skrynnik '''(1953–1981), known as the "'''Moldavian [[Andrei Chikatilo|Chikatilo]]'''", is a [[Soviet]] [[serial killer]] who committed his crimes in [[Yakutia]] and [[Kishinev]].

== Biography ==
The exact date and place of birth of Skrynnik is unclear (it is known that he lived Kishinev and in 1980 he was 27 years old).&lt;ref name="brw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brw.md/moldavskii-maniac-aleksander-skrynnikov|website=brw.md|title=Александр Скрынник. Молдавские маньяки ⋆ BRW Журнал|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered himself a loser in his personal life, and envied other men. His marriage was unhappy: after he had a child, Skrynnik realized that he did not love his wife. One day, his friend Feodosiy Glukharyov boasted to him about his success in love. After this, Skrynnik made an advertisement in the newspaper that he was searching for a lover, but the girl he met infected him with [[venereal disease]], which made Skrynnik decide that women are the source of all the ills in the world, and must be destroyed.

=== Murders ===
In the mid-1970s, Skrynnik went to work in Yakutia. There he killed stewardess Nina Puganova, cutting off her breasts and genitals. Although her torn body was found, it did not lead to the killer, and the murder remained unsolved until Skrynnik's capture.

Later, Skrynnik returned to Kishinev, where he worked as a carpenter in the "Bucuria" factory, was an [[udarnik]] and a candidate member of the [[CPSU]]. In 1980, he committed another murder. He invited to a date Irina Trasyn, who had a seven-year-old child, treating her with ice cream before stabbing her multiple times with a knife. Skrynnin then removed her eyes and cut off her head, which he put in a briefcase. The killer then brought this portfolio to Glukharyov, attaching the following note to it:{{Cquote
| quote = Fedor, did you see the gift? This is your example. Prepare 10 thousand! Or your daughter will be headless too. Come to the station in the evening, and bring the money.}}  Initially, Glukharyov was suspected of killing her. The investigation had a version that he had been a member of a criminal group but decided to cut off ties with the criminal world, and they had decided to intimidate him. It was impossible to identify the victim, as she was left without eyes. With the permission of the [[Moldavian SSR]], the head of the murdered Trasyn was shown on television. After that, police was called by 7-year-old Viktor Trasyn, the son of the deceased. He recognized his mother, whom he had not seen in a week. As he was left an orphan, the boy was put in an orphanage.

Soon after, Skrynnik killed a new victim named Anastasia Mikhailova, bringing to Glukharyov her severed hand. The examination later established that the head and the hand belonged to different people. Different theories began to appear: some claimed that there were necromancer-sorcerers in Kishinev, digging up corpses from the graves, while others claimed that a maniac who had operated in the USSR at the time, [[Nikolai Dzhumagaliev]], had reached the Moldovan capital. A note had been placed yet again in the hand of the victim:{{Cquote
| quote = Fedor, you still do not want to play? You do not believe that we are not afraid of blood? Then kiss the female hand. In three days you will bring money to the station. Otherwise, we will chop your daughter into pieces.}} After reading the letter, operatives decided to put guards on watch for Oksana, Glukharyov's daughter. Once Skrynnik, who was among the suspects, went into the Glukharyovs' house courtyard, the plain-clothed operatives tried to detain him, but Oksana told them: "Let Uncle Sasha go, he is good." The decided to organize a meeting between Glukharyov and the alleged gangsters - the possible murderers. Under the guise of railway workers at the [[Chișinău railway station|Kishinev station]], they set up an ambush. Glukharyov arrived at the station, but one came to him.

While investigating the case, Anatoly Magdalyuk, senior investigator for particularly important cases under the Prosecutor's Office of the Moldavian SSR, drew attention to an interesting fact: Glukharyov preferred that people not call him Feodosiy, but Fedor - a name only relatives and good friends called him. From this followed the conclusion that the murder was committed by a person who knows Glukharyov very well. His second cousin, Dmitry Kozintsev, a restaurant owner to whom Glukharyov took his bride on the wedding, came into view. A scandal broke out, with Kozintsev threatening to kill Glukharyov, but the matter was hushed up. Once at the station, an undercover operative called Dmitry Kozintsev by name and surname, upon which he tried to flee, but stumbled and was quickly detained. However, it turned out that Kozintsev was only involved in the embezzlement of socialist property, which he had been long suspected of.

Not long after, Skrynnik attack another girl, Olga Lebedeva, in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of Lenin Komsomol. He tried to rape and kill her, but the victim managed to escape and call for help. She said that the offender shouted at her: "I will cut you into pieces, creature". These words caused the investigators to go investigate the park, where they found the headless body of Trasyn. Lebedeva said that she had seen her attacker's face, and it was a man she had seen previously after the announcement. He had come to see her, but quickly left and then attacked her (so he attacked her again this time). She had kept the letters from him, the author of which turned out to be Skrynnik. However, it wasn't possible to compare the handwritings of the killer and Glukharyov, as the notes the maniac sent were written in block letters. Skrynnik was then summoned to the military registration and enlistment office, where he was required to fill out documents in block letters, and they coincided with the handwritings of the killer.

=== Arrest, trial ===
Alexander Skrynnik was detained at the "Patria" cinema, where he had gone with a girl. He admitted his crimes without any repentance, calling himself an "orderly of nature". At his trial, he stated that he would describe all the terrible things he had done and asked for those with a weak stomach to leave. The Supreme Court of the Moldavian SSR sentenced Skrynnik to death, and he was subsequently [[executed by firing squad]], but the exact date is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.sputnik.md/incidents/20171217/16170175/manjak-serijnyj-ubijca-prestuplenie.html|title=Сексуальные маньяки и серийные убийцы в Молдове|date=2017-12-17|publisher=[[Sputnik|Sputnik Молдова]]|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Latif Sharif''', first name also spelled '''Abdel''' (September 19, 1947 &amp;ndash; June 1, 2006), was an Egyptian-born American [[chemistry|chemist]] and chief suspect in the [[Deaths in Ciudad Juárez|Juárez killings]], a decade-long murder spree that began in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Ciudad Juárez]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/61426.html|title=Egyptian charged of feminicide death in Chihuahua|author=Carlos Coria Rivas and Carlos Lui C.

==Background==
===Childhood and youth===
Sharif was born into a Muslim family in Egypt as an only child. Growing up he suffered constant sexual abuse from his father and several male relatives.&lt;ref name=juarez&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.periodistasenlinea.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=76|title=Endless doubt after Sharif's death|author=Tony Diaz|publisher=periodistasenlinea.org|date=2012|accessdate=11 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his father was opposed to him attending school, Sharif showed signs of above-average intelligence, spending his time training carrier pigeons and fishing in the river. At age 12, at his father's behest, he agreed to marry to his 10-year-old cousin, but three years later Sharif abandoned that promise to instead travel to the [[United States]]. His family disapproved and his aunt allegedly cast a spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVMsAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;dq=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eICuT_z5MuLy2QWLkJHqCA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ|title=Bones in the desert|author=Sergio Rodríguez González|accessdate=12 May 2012|page=334|location=Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, Sharif studied chemical engineering at Cairo University, where he achieved an average of 9.9. Working as a high school and university instructor, he spent some time in the [[Soviet Union]] before traveling to [[New York (state)|New York]] to find work in cosmetics, paint, and skin-care companies. He was considered to be professional, attractive, and successful. Women became his obsession during his 21-year stay in the United States. He married twice and had five other partners with whom he lived for long periods.

===Arrival and life in America===
Sharif emigrated legally to the United States in 1970, arriving in New York, where he began a job at which he remained employed eight years until being fired in 1978 because of his alcohol problems. He then moved to [[Pennsylvania]], where he resided for three years. In 1981 he moved to [[Florida]], where he was employed in the company Cercoa, Inc. During this time, he committed his first sexual assaults; in 1982, he got married but they quickly divorced as a result of his violence toward his wife.&lt;ref name=ciudad/&gt; He remained a prominent chemist, and during a stay in Mexico he kept patents on various petrochemical processes he had invented.&lt;ref name=abdul&gt;{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgJhFnnvGzYC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eICuT_z5MuLy2QWLkJHqCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=abdel%20latif%20sharif&amp;f=false|title=Governance in crisis: crime, conflict and violence in Latin America|author=Erick Lopez Tagle Gomez|publisher=Books in network|edition=1|pages=179-800|accessdate=12 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
===Imputation for sexual abuse===
According to official accounts, Sharif was a promiscuous alcoholic and pedophile. He allegedly tortured dying animals during his hunting expeditions and collected girls' clothes. According to other sources, this characterization of Sharif was an invention of the prosecution to make credible accusations against him.

Sharif's first alleged sexual assault took place on 2 May 1981 in [[North Palm Beach, Florida]], where he tricked a woman by promising her a job as a housekeeper. He kidnapped the woman, beat her, and sexually assaulted her. Afterwards he let the woman go, with the woman claiming that he said:
{{cquote|quote="Oh, did I hurt you? I think you should go to a hospital."|source=Abdul Latif Sharif towards the woman.&lt;ref name=ciudad/&gt;}}

Sharif's defence was provided by Cercoa, Inc. Though Sharif argued that the sex was consensual, he was convicted on charges of assault, rape, and illegal deprivation of liberty, and was released on [[parole]].

Almost immediately after leaving prison, in August 1981, he assaulted another woman. On this occasion he was sentenced to 45 days in prison after a defense once again financed by Cercoa, Inc.&lt;ref name=juarez/&gt; Curiously, Sharif was not dismissed until 1982.

In 1982, after his dismissal, he moved to [[Gainesville, Florida]], where he married. This wife also soon divorced him after he had beaten her to unconsciousness. On 17 March 1983, Sharif's third rape was reported. He again used the deception of a job as a housekeeper, luring a woman to his house. He hit, raped, and threatened her, but she managed to escape and report him. This time, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, in 1984.

After spending only 5 years in prison, Sharif was released in 1989, but he was not deported to Egypt even though the judge had ruled that this would be the case. That year he moved to [[Midland, Texas]], where he was hired by the transnational company Benchmark Research and Technology. In 1991 he was arrested for drunk driving but was again not deported. In 1993 he allegedly raped a woman again, and his defense was sponsored by Benchmark Research and Technology. He was released on parole with the promise that he would never set foot on American soil again.

On 14 May 1994, Sharif moved to Ciudad Juárez, still technically working as a Benchmark employee.

The incidents in which he was involved in the U.S. were the following:
* Joanne Collins Poldesmink (3 March 1981 in North Palm Beach, Florida)
Joanne was Sharif's girlfriend, towards whom he was allegedly verbally abusive. Collins filed legal charges against Sharif, which she later dropped.
* Janet Stroven, sexual assault
Sharif met this woman in a hotel bar where he attended a chemist convention. Stroven would later file sexual assault charges against Sharif.
* Molly Fleming, sexual assault (2 May 1981)
Sharif was accused by his neighbor Molly Fleming of drugging and sexually assaulting her. He was given 5 years of conditional release.
* Susan Wait, sexual assault
Wait was a university student who lived in Sharif's house. She accused him of assault and the police arrested him for this and for transferring his parole from a previous incident. He was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison, of which he served 5 years and 4 months. While imprisoned he taught chemistry to his fellow inmates.
* Nancy Díaz, sexual assault (Midland, Texas)
Díaz accused Sharif of sexual assault, but the charges were eventually dropped.

Due to these five incidents, Sharif was deported from the United States.

===Murders===
Sharif's first alleged murder occurred in Mexico in March 1995, but there were indications that he was a scapegoat of the Chihuahua Attorney General's Office, who made him into a serial killer. It was claimed that he could have begun killing from 1978 to 1981 while still residing in Pennsylvania, when the unsolved disappearances of several women and girls occurred. However, Sharif was never connected to these events.

Upon his arrival in Mexico in 1994, Sharif settled in the luxurious and exclusive Rinconadas de San Marcos neighbourhood of Ciudad Juárez, with all the expenses sponsored by the company he worked for. Sharif distinguished himself as an intelligent man, patenting 25 chemical formulas. It was here that his prolific career as a serial killer allegedly lasted from 1994 to 1995.

==Detention, trial and conviction==
On 3 October 1995, Sharif was reported by a prostitute, 19-year-old Blanca Estela Díaz, as having kidnapped her for three days, during which she was beaten, raped, and threatened with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last1=Rodríguez|first1=Teresa|last2=Montané|first2=Diana|last3=Pulitzer|first3=Lisa|title=The Daughters of Juárez (Daughters of Juárez): An authentic story of serial murders south of the border|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z39kasUZ_YkC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sergio+armendariz+diaz+ciudad+juarez&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V0jnUJz1Oc2A2AXz_IG4BQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sergio%20armendariz%20diaz%20ciudad%20juarez&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2013|language=Spanish|edition=1.ª|year=2007|publisher=Simons &amp; Schuster, Inc.|location=New York, United States|isbn=978-0-7432-9302-0|chapter=3. The mutilator of Juárez|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dismissed on the grounds that, contrary to her claims, there were no signs of sexual abuse. However, the Chihuahua government was being pressured to find the perpetrator of the Ciudad Juárez femicides in Lote Bravo and Sharif, with his criminal background, was the ideal candidate to be the serial killer. The Chihuahua Attorney General's Office sought to establish him as responsible for the multiple homicides.

Within 20 minutes of his release, Sharif was remanded for the disappearance of Elizabeth Castro García, a 17-year-old girl with whom Sharif allegedly had a relationship. Elizabeth's sister, Eunice, had reported her disappearance on 15 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The deaths of Ciudad Juárez: the case of Elizabeth Castro García and Abdul Latif Sharif|author=Gregorio Ortega|publisher=Fontamara Series|page=143|date=1999|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpse of a woman who matched Castro's description was found buried in the desert of Lote Bravo, but the investigation took a turn when it was found that Elizabeth Castro was alive and that the body was that of a woman who disappeared in March 1995, Silvia Rivera Salas. According to witnesses, Silvia had been kidnapped by two suspects in a van.

Sharif was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison for the death of Silvia Rivera Salas. A new criminal proceeding was also opened, accusing him of murdering 17 other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://asesinosenseriebios.blogspot.mx/2009/09/el-depredador-de-ciudad-juarez-mexico.html|title="The Predator of Ciudad Juárez" (Mexico)|accessdate=4 January 2013|last=Rivera|first=Horacio B.|date=29 September 2009|newspaper=Encyclopedia of serial killers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was in prison, corpses of raped and strangled women continued to appear in different areas of Ciudad Juárez. The authorities sold an image of Sharif to the press portraying him as the psychopathic rapist killer who controlled the murders from prison.

==Controversy==
===Scapegoat===
Sharif was known in Ciudad Juárez as a sexual criminal with a long history of assaulting women, and it was not difficult for all to believe that he was responsible for the murders. In addition to the prosecution and the Chiahuahuan government, the people believed that one person could be put in place as the sole perpetrator. This claim calmed the families of the murdered and not the national, but the international press that had its sights on Ciudad Juárez - Sharif did not speak Spanish, was a foreigner, without family and with a history of sexual assaults; he was the right person to point as the killer. One day, however, Sharif summoned the media to give a press conference in which he would say the names of the real murderers of the women found dead in Lote Bravo. Under pressure from the press and because of his scarce Spanish, names like and [[Alejandro Máynez|Alejandro]] and Melchor Máynez came to light. Alejandro had come to fall in love with a dark, thin and humble girl, and he, as he was known through Juárez, was the adopted son of a prominent Juárez businessman who owned gambling houses, bars and leisure spots on the border with [[El Paso, Texas]]. After Alejandro murdered the girl, Sharif claimed to have met him in a bar where he had boasted about raped and murdered the girls with the help of his cousin Melchor. The authorities inquired about that information because he knew that Maynez's father had paid them off so his son could enjoy total immunity. It indeed had happened, because Alejandro was never questioned or bothered to give his version of the facts regarding what was said by Sharif. Sharif began to hold constant press conferences, a situation that was deemed inconvenient by the High commanders of the Attorney General's Office in Chiahuahua, so they transferred him to the Chihuahua prison as a highly dangerous prisoner. They denied him the right to see his defense attorney many times with any kind of pretext. Meanwhile, the situation in Juárez worsened, because even with Sharif in jail, bodies of raped and strangled young girls under the same modus operandi continued to appear.

Irene Blancas, defense attorney for Sharif, pointed out that she suffered constant threats inside the prison, that the story about him was absurd, and even the same judge who had sentenced him to 60 years, in a personal conversation with the defender of Sharif, admitted to not having enough evidence to convict him. However, the same judge knew that he would not be released, that Sharif would die in prison in strange circumstances, with the authorities later revealing that he had died of a heart attack.

===New Crimes===
Between October 1995 and April 1996, while Sharif was already imprisoned, a further 12 feminicides were registered in the city. In 1995, a group of serial killers who acted in a group, [[The Ciudad Juárez Rebels]], were arrested and charged with murdering 17 women.

That same year, another serial killer group, [[The Ruteros of Ciudad Juárez]], were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|first=Villalpando Moreno|last=Rubén|title=Someone very powerful, with police protection, after the impunity of feminicides of Ciudad Juárez: experts and activists|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2002/11/04/articulos/51_juarez.htm|publisher=La Jornada|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authorities, all of them were hired by Sharif  to commit the murders and thus divert the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141646/http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731|url=http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731|title=The dead ones of Juárez of Victor Ronquillo: the morbid of the cynical reason|author=José Manuel García-García|publisher=Al Margen|date=23 March 2005|archivedate=6 October 2014|accessdate=2 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Sharif faced 17 charges of aggravated material homicide, 24 counts of intellectual homicide, dozens of charges for kidnapping and rape, and charges of organized crime and illegal human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127101929/http://contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2010/10/17/feminicidios-en-juarez-policias-fabrican-culpables/|url=http://contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2010/10/17/feminicidios-en-juarez-policias-fabrican-culpables/|title=Feminicides in Juárez:police fabricate guilt|author=Santiago Santorum Gallur|publisher=Contralínea 204|date=7 October 2010|archive-date=27 January 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Abdul Latif Sharif died on June 2, 2006, at the age of 59, in the Social Rehabilitation Center of Chihuahua, from a cardiact arrest consistent with a hypovolemic shock generated by a chronic hemorrhage due to [[peptic ulcer disease]]. Since 2003, he had been diagnosed with [[liver cirrhosis]] subsequent to [[hepatitis C]] and [[alcoholic hepatitis]], and a major depressive disorder, at least according to authorities.

He was buried in Mexico, as no relative could be found to repatriate his remains. His funeral was attended by the Egyptian consul in Mexico, Karim El Sadat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/353176.html|title=They buried the feminicides in Ciudad Juárez|author=Carlos Coria Rivas|publisher=The Universal Chihuahua|date=3 July 2006|accessdate=12 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he was innocent until his death.

Ever since Sharif's death to this day the murders continue, with the same modus operandi with which they had started, and women continue to disappear since 1993.

'''Roberto Succo''' (April 3, 1962 in [[Mestre]] – May 23, 1988 in [[Vicenza]]) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[serial killer]] who committed several murders and other violent crimes mostly in Italy and France in the 1980s.

==Murders==
Succo was born in [[Mestre]]. On 9 April 1981 he fatally stabbed his mother Maria 32 times, and his father, a [[Polizia di Stato|police officer]], who had refused to lend him their car. He hid their bodies in the bathtub covered in water and lime to delay the discovery of the murders and fled with his father's [[Beretta 92|service pistol]].

He then fled from Mestre,&lt;ref name=Succo&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/03/01/assassino-per-sei-volte-si-uccidere.html|title=Six-time assassin "Yes, I like killing"|publisher=La Repubblica|date=1 March 1988|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an investigation into the murders of the Succo couple immediately connected them to the son, who was arrested two days later at the exit of a pizzeria in [[San Pietro al Natisone]], not far from the border with [[Yugoslavia]], after he had briefly returned to the crime scene.

After Succo was caught, he was judged [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and sentenced to ten years in a [[psychiatric imprisonment|psychiatric prison]] in [[Reggio Emilia]]. While serving his sentence, he  was a model prisoner who studied [[geology]] at the [[University of Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=nIHYDa9VeD0C&amp;pg=PT88&amp;dq=roberto+succo+g%C3%A9ologie&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj20PG47bzYAhXBWxQKHeI4D5wQuwUIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=roberto%20succo%20g%C3%A9ologie&amp;f=false|title=Les tueurs en série|last=Vergès|first=Jean-Pierre|date=26 September 2007|publisher=Hachette Pratique|isbn=9782012301573|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving five years of his sentence, on May 15, 1986 while on freedom privileges, Succo escaped from the psychiatric hospital. He evaded police and escaped to [[France]] by rail, using fake documents and changing his surname to "Kurt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.gazzettino.it/nordest/venezia/succo_il_killer_dagli_occhi_di_ghiaccio_che_terrorizz_mestre_e_la_francia/notizie/316351.shtml|title=Succo, the ice-eyed killer terrified Mestre and France|publisher=Il Gazzettino|date=18 August 2003|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years, he committed numerous crimes, including [[burglary]], [[rape]] and murder. In France, he killed two women, a physician, and two [[National Police (France)|police officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/informations/la-cavale-de-roberto-succo_722204.html|title=La cavale de Roberto Succo|last=Pelletier|first=Eric|date=3 April 2008|work=L'Express |access-date=2 January 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/02/12/un-italiano-il-ricercato-in.html ''The Italian is sought fter N.1 in France'', La Repubblica, February 12, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; He [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], [[Carjacking|hijacked]], and terrorized people in three European countries. He was considered Public Enemy number one by France, Italy, and [[Switzerland]].

After being recognized by a student in [[Aix-les-Bains]] on April 6, Succo returned to Italy. On 28 February 1988 he was caught in [[Mestre]],&lt;ref name=Succo/&gt; his hometown. On March 1, 1988, in the course of an escape attempt, he fell from the roof of the [[Treviso]] prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/03/02/ultima-impresa-di-rambo-killer.html ''The last venture of the Rambo-killer'', La Repubblica, March 2, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

He committed [[suicide]] in his cell in [[Vicenza]], in the "San Pius X" prison on May 23, 1988, suffocating himself with a plastic bag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/05/24/meglio-morto-che-prigioniero.html ''Better dead than a prisoner'', La Repubblica, May 24, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later references==
In 1988, [[Bernard-Marie Koltès]] wrote a play (''Roberto Zucco''){{efn|Koltès changed the spelling of his title character's name, as some early newspaper accounts had misspelled it, to underscore his lack of interest in "representational validity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Crime and Media in Contemporary France| first=Deborah Streifford|last= Reisinger| pages=65, 84|date=2007| publisher =Purdue University Press| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e23ZrdFFUqYC&amp;pg=PA84&amp; |access-date= 23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} loosely based on Succo's life and crimes. French journalist [[Pascale Froment]] wrote a [[non-fiction]] account of Succo's crimes that appeared as ''Je te tue. Histoire vraie de Roberto Succo assassin sans raison'' in 1991, and it served as the basis for the 2001 film ''[[Roberto Succo (film)|Roberto Succo]]'' directed by Cédric Kahn.

'''Gianfranco Stevanin''' (born October 2, 1960), known as the '''"Monster of Terrazzo"''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and [[serial killer]], convicted of murdering six women between 1993 and 1994. His case had great prominence in the national media and raised a debate on the question of incapability of criminals understanding the consequences of their acts.

== Capture ==
On November 16, 1994, in [[Vicenza]], Stevanin picked up a prostitute named Gabriele Musger in his [[Volvo 240]], offering her money to have sex and take pictures of her. After several hours of extreme sexual games, the prostitute tried to escape through the window of a bathroom and later refused to take other pictures, resulting in being threatened with a knife by Stevanin. To save her life, she offered Gianfranco all her savings (about 25 million [[Italian lira|lires]]) if he let her go,&lt;ref name=Gian&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/11/21/tracce-di-due-scomparse-nella-casa-degli.html Traces of two disappears in the house of horrors] Repubblica.it&lt;/ref&gt; and the maniac accepted; however, the money was at Musger's house and then the two got into his car to go get it. At toll booth at Vicenza, Stevanin stopped to pay the toll, and at that moment the prostitute managed to get out of the car, go to a police car and report her client for sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/16/mi-uso-come-una-schiava-sono.html 'Used' As a Slave, Saved by Money] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; The police arrested him for sexual assault, extortion, and possession of a toy gun without the regular red cap. Following this event, he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120714201900/http://quotidianonet.ilsole24ore.com/2000/12/23/1635059-Stevanin-ferito-alla-gola-nel-manicomio-criminale.shtml Stevanin wounded in the throat in the criminal asylum. The farmer in the 'casolare degli horrors', accused of having slaughtered six women, was attacked by an immigrant inmate]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==
During searches of his house, investigators found prohibited pornographic material (including over 7000 photographs personally taken by Stevanin and his partners), anatomy books, boxes containing pubic hair and a file containing information on all his partners.&lt;ref name=Gian/&gt; Although the police consider Stevanin the only one in the group who violated and attempted extortion, investigators began to suspect more serious crimes after finding objects belonging to a woman named Biljana Pavlovic, whom has been missing since August 1994, and Claudia Pulejo.&lt;ref name=Gian/&gt; The two girls were also mentioned in Stevanin's files. The man justified himself by saying that he had short relationships with them and that the clothes were just a token of love that the girls had left him.

On July 3, 1995, a farmer from [[Terrazzo, Veneto|Terrazzo]] found a sack containing the remains of a corpse in a plot near Stevanin's house. Gianfranco became a murder suspect, and the magistrate sent some bulldozers to look for other bodies.

On November 12, 1995, the body of another woman was found; this time the body was also found in a sack,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/17/un-sacco-di-plastica-trovata-la-traccia.html A Plastic Bag Found The Trace That Leads To Assassin] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; but on this occasion the discovery took place in a land owned by Stevanin, with the DNA test unequivocally showing that the body was that of Biljana Pavlovic. On December 1, 1995, a third body was found, that of Claudia Pulejo.&lt;ref name=broke&gt;[https://archive.today/20120715063449/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=1500195] Archive of lastampa.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevanin was questioned by the investigators but his attitude was controversial: at times he seemed to remember something, and then denied it immediately, claiming that he had an empty memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/15/signor-giudice-parlero.html Signor Giudice, Parlero] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; Other murders attributed to him include the murder of [[Austria]]n prostitute Roswita Adlassnig, who had been missing for a few months and present both in Stevanin's photos and his files, and another murder of an unidentified woman with whom he evidently engaged in a sexual act with while she was dead.

In September 24, 1996 (after the partial confession of Stevanin), another unidentified body was found in the [[Adige]]. After a DNA test, the body was recognized as that of Blazenca Smolijo.

== Confessions ==
On July 19, 1996, Stevanin decided to confess and claimed to have dismembered the bodies of four women,&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; but that their murders weren't premeditated, as they had died during extreme sexual relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/08/25/sono-morte-dopo-un-gioco-di.html 'I Am Death After a Sex Game'] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of Pulejo, due a [[heroin]] [[overdose]].&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; Regarding the unidentified corpse, he stated that she was a student whose name and face he did not remember, saying he had met her only three or four times. Stevanin later claimed that he acted without knowing what he was doing, as if his actions were just dreams.

== Trial ==
After several sessions of psychiatric examinations, Stevanin was declared processable and able to understand the consequences of his actions, with the experts saying that he was mentally capable, intelligent (with an IQ of 114) and a skilled computist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/novembre/05/Mostro_Terrazzo_Stevanin_capace_intendere_co_0_9611058850.shtml The Monster of Terrazzo. "Stevanin able to understand and want"]&lt;/ref&gt; The defense experts tried to challenge the psychiatric report, stating that all the disturbances of Gianfranco Stevanin are due to a previous motorcycle accident that almost cost him his life.

Stevanin showed at the sessions with a shaved head, to show well the evident scar that according to the defense is at the base of everything. The first sentence by the Court of Assizes of Verona, on January 29, 1998, condemned Gianfranco Stevanin to [[life imprisonment]], of which 3 years in total daytime isolation.

In January 1999, Stevanin sold his house and all the land he owned to partially compensate the families of the victims.&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; On July 7, the Appellate Court of Venice absolved the accused of murder charges because he was incapable of understanding his actions and resentenced him to 10.5 years for concealment and mutilation of a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/luglio/08/Stevanin_assolto_manicomio_co_0_9907085948.shtml Stevanin acquitted: goes to the asylum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/stefi/stefi/stefi.html?ref=search The killer Stevanin sentenced to 10 years] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the Court of Cassation of [[Rome]] then canceled the sentence by "illogical motivation", referring to a new section of appeal reviewing of the case. In December 2000, while he was locked up in a mental asylum, Stevanin was seriously injured in the neck with a razor bite inflicted by another non-European prisoner.&lt;ref name=broke/&gt;

The final sentence was announced on March 23, 2001: the Appellate Court of Venice declared that Gianfranco Stevanin was capable of understanding his crimes, which is why his sentence was automatically confirmed to life imprisonment. The Court of Cassation confirmed the sentence, rejecting the defense's demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=17906 Rainews24]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is still{{As of when?|date=January 2019}} imprisoned in the [[Sulmona]] prison in [[Abruzzo]], where he saved the life of a cellmate who tried to commit suicide twice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/08/19/stevanin-svento-tentato-suicidio.html Stevanin foiled attempted suicide] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, he told the press that he did not remember anything about his murders and also affirmed his desire to become a [[Franciscan]] lay brother because of his mother's death, thus emulating another case that occurred seventy years ago, when [[Alessandro Serenelli]], murderer of [[Maria Goretti]], also became a Franciscan while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/verona/notizie/cronaca/2010/1-settembre-2010/serial-killer-prostitute-si-fa-frate-1703677512710.shtml The serial killer of prostitutes wants to become a lay brother]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad Suradji''' (12 December 1952 – 10 July 2008), also known as '''Nasib Kelewang''' and '''Datuk Maringgi''', was an [[Indonesia]]n [[serial killer]] who admitted to murdering 42 girls and women between 1986 and 1997. Suradji's victims, ranging in age between 11 and 30, were strangled after being buried in the ground up to their waists as part of a [[ritual]].&lt;ref name=documentary&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmad Suradji: Indonesia's Sorcerer From Hell|publisher=[[Mediacorp Channel 5]]|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He buried his victims in a [[sugarcane]] plantation near his home, with their heads facing his house, which he believed would give him extra power.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/2286216/Black-Magic-Killer-executed-for-42-murders.html|title=Black Magic Killer executed for 42 murders|date=11 July 2008|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ahmad Suradji lived in [[Medan]], the capital of [[Indonesia]]'s [[North Sumatra]] province. He worked as a cattle-breeder and as a ''[[dukun]]'', a class of [[shaman]] reputed to possess supernatural powers. Suradji's clientele were often women seeking his guidance on how to find good fortune or maintain their beauty. According to Suradji, his deceased father visited him in a dream in 1986 and commanded him to murder 70 women as part of a [[black magic]] ritual.

==Death==
His three wives, who were sisters, were also arrested for assisting in the murders and helping him hide the bodies. One of his wives, Tumini, was tried as his accomplice and was sentenced to death before it was reduced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034352/Sorcerer-killed-42-women-girls-enhance-magical-powers.html|title=Shaman murdered 42 women and girls in a bid to enhance his magical powers|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He was sentenced to death by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] and executed on 10 July 2008.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;

==Murders==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
On 24 April 1997, 21-year-old Sri Kemala Dewi asked a 15-year-old [[rickshaw]] puller named Andreas to take her to "Datuk". She informed him to keep it a secret and never requested to be picked up.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Three days later, Dewi's naked and decomposing body was found in a sugarcane field by a man and was later dug up by a group of people who then called the police.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Andreas reported to the police and Dewi's family that he had dropped her off at Suradji's house three days earlier, and so police visited Suradji for confrontation.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Although he denied any links with Dewi's killing, police found Dewi's handbag, dress and bracelet in his home. He was later arrested on 30 April 1997.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; During interrogation, Suradji slowly confessed to Dewi's murder but also revealed that he had killed up to 42 girls in the same fashion and an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] process had to be carried out in the sugarcane field where Dewi's body was located.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Throughout the process, 42 bodies had been found with some being so decomposed to the point where they were unidentifiable.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;

He told police that he had a dream in 1986 in which his father's ghost directed him to drink the saliva of 70 dead young women so that he could become a mystic healer.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji thought that it would take him too long to encounter 70 dead women singly and so he took up the initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; As a [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]], or [[dukun]], women came to him for spiritual advice for such things like making themselves more beautiful or richer or so Suradji could cast a spell on their spouses so they'll never have an affair.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He would take them into a sugarcane field and bury them up to their waist, claiming it was part of the ritual.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He would then strangle them until they were dead and proceed to drink their saliva. After, he would strip the clothes from their bodies to accelerate decomposition and bury them back into the ground with their heads pointing toward his house.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji stated the following to the police:

{{quote|My father did not specifically advise me to kill people. So I was thinking, it would take ages if I have to wait to get seventy women. I was trying to get to it as fast as possible, I took my own initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;}}

'''Charles Sobhraj''' (born 6 April 1944), is a [[France|French]] [[thief]], [[fraud]]ster and [[serial killer]] of [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Indian people|Indian]] origin who preyed on Western tourists, primarily [[beatniks]], throughout the [[Hippie Trail]] of [[Southeast Asia]] during the 1970s. He was best known as '''the Bikini Killer''' due to the attire of his victims, as well as '''the Splitting Killer''' and '''the Serpent''', due to his skill at deception and evasion. Sobhraj allegedly committed at least a dozen murders and was convicted and jailed in [[India]] from 1976 to 1997. After his release, he retired as a celebrity in [[Paris]]. Sobhraj later returned to [[Nepal]] in 2003, where he was arrested,  tried, and received a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/sobhraj-finally-convicted-life-sentenced-79.html|title=Sobhraj finally Convicted &amp; Life-sentenced|accessdate=30 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625033251/http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/sobhraj-finally-convicted-life-sentenced-79.html|archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj is widely believed to be a [[psychopath]]. He had an intense hatred of [[hippies]], and many of his murders reflected this. He was described as devilishly handsome, and did not refrain from using his attractiveness to his advantage in his criminal career. This, as well as his cunning and cultured personality, ensured his celebrity status long before his release from prison. He enjoyed his fame, charging large sums for interviews and film rights. He has been the subject of four biographies, three documentaries and a [[Bollywood]] movie titled ''[[Main Aur Charles]]''. Sobhraj's return to Nepal, where he was still eagerly sought by authorities, is thought to be the result of his yearning for attention and overconfidence in his own intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bikini Killer|url=http://www.asian-news-channel.tv/index.php/entertainment/67-bollywood/6120-the-bikini-killer|accessdate=23 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104742/http://www.asian-news-channel.tv/index.php/entertainment/67-bollywood/6120-the-bikini-killer|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Sobhraj was born as '''Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj''' to [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] shop girl Tran Loang Phun, and [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] businessman Sobhraj Hatchand Bhaonani, who was based in [[Saigon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAZl6QOyK0|title=SOBHRAJ – Or How To Be Friends With A Serial Killer (FULL FEATURE)|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://puzzups.com/bikini-killer-charles-sobhraj-complete-life-story-where-is-he-now/|title=Bikini killer Charles Sobhraj and his complete life story!

There he was [[child neglect|neglected]] in favour of the couple's later children. However, Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]] and [[France]] with the family. As a teenager, he began to commit petty crimes and received his first jail sentence (for [[burglary]]) in 1963, serving time at [[Poissy]] prison near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.za/famous_criminal/93/the_crimes/1/Charles_Sobhraj_The_Serpent.htm|title=Charles Sobhraj: The Serpent – Famous Criminal – The Crimes|accessdate=27 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009013306/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.za/famous_criminal/93/the_crimes/1/Charles_Sobhraj_The_Serpent.htm|archive-date=9 October 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned, Sobhraj eagerly manipulated prison officials into granting him special favours, such as being allowed to keep books in his cell. Around the same time, he met and endeared himself to Felix d'Escogne, a wealthy young man and prison volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/charles_sobraj/4.html Profile], trutv.com; accessed 1 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being paroled, Sobhraj moved in with d'Escogne and shared his time between moving between the high society of Paris and the criminal underworld. He began accumulating riches through a series of burglaries and [[scam]]s. During this time, Sobhraj met and began a passionate relationship with Chantal Compagnon, a young Parisian woman from a conservative family. Sobhraj proposed marriage to Compagnon, but was arrested later the same day for attempting to [[resisting arrest|evade police]] while driving a [[motor vehicle theft|stolen vehicle]]. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, yet Chantal remained supportive throughout the entirety of his sentence. Sobhraj and Chantal were wed upon his release.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/12-things-you-didn%E2%80%99t-know-about-the-infamous-charles-sobhraj-233025.html|title=12 Things You Didn't Know About The Infamous Charles Sobhraj|work=indiatimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj, along with a pregnant Chantal, left France in 1970 for [[Asia]] to escape arrest. After traveling through [[Eastern Europe]] with fake documents, robbing tourists whom they befriended along the way, Sobhraj arrived in [[Mumbai]] later the same year. Here, Chantal gave birth to a baby girl, Usha. In the meantime, Sobhraj resumed his criminal lifestyle, running a car theft and [[smuggling]] operation. Sobhraj's growing profits went towards his budding [[gambling addiction]].&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;

In 1973, Sobhraj was arrested and imprisoned after an unsuccessful [[armed robbery]] attempt on a jewellery store at Hotel Ashoka. Sobhraj was able to escape, with Chantal's help, due to faking illness, but was re-captured shortly thereafter. Sobhraj borrowed money for [[bail]] from his father, and soon after fled to [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/charles-sobhraj-the-serpent/crime Sobhraj profile], crimeandinvestigation.co.uk; accessed 1 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There, the couple begun to rob tourists on the [[Hippie Trail]], only to be arrested once again. Again, Sobhraj escaped in the same way he had in India; feigning illness and drugging the hospital guard. Sobhraj then fled to [[Iran]], leaving his family behind. Chantal, although still loyal to Sobhraj, but wishing to leave their criminal past behind, returned to France and vowed never to see him again.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/its-a-secret-0000450-v21n9|title=It's a Secret: My Time with Charles Sobhraj, the Bikini Killer|author=Gary Indiana|work=VICE|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj spent the next two years on the run, using as many as ten [[identity theft|stolen passports]]. He passed through various countries in Eastern Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Sobhraj was joined by his younger half-brother, André, in [[Istanbul]]. Sobhraj and André quickly became partners in crime, participating in various criminal activities in both [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]]. The duo were eventually arrested in [[Athens]]. After an identity-switch hoax went awry, Sobhraj managed to escape, but his half-brother was left behind. André was turned over to the Turkish police by Greek authorities and served an 18-year sentence.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/764804/charles-sobhraj-hated-india-but-the-country-got-to-him-in-the-end|title=Charles Sobhraj hated India, but the country got to him in the end|author=Nandini Ramnath|work=Scroll.in|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On the run again, Sobhraj financed his lifestyle by posing as either a [[gemstone|gem]] salesman or [[drug dealing|drug dealer]] to impress and befriend tourists, whom he then [[fraud|defrauded]]. In [[Thailand]], Sobhraj met [[:W:Fr:Marie-Andrée Leclerc|Marie-Andrée Leclerc]] (1945–1984) from [[Lévis, Quebec|Lévis]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], a tourist looking for adventure. Dominated by Sobhraj, she quickly became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women.

Sobhraj gathered followers by gaining their loyalty: a typical scam was to help his target out of difficult situations. In one case, he helped two former French policemen, Yannick and Jacques, recover missing passports that Sobhraj himself had actually stolen. In another scheme, Sobhraj provided shelter to a Frenchman, Dominique Rennelleau, who appeared to be suffering from [[dysentery]]; Sobhraj had actually [[poison]]ed Rennelleau. He was finally joined by a young Indian man, Ajay Chowdhury, a fellow criminal who became Sobhraj's second-in-command.&lt;ref name=ajay1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/charles_sobraj/11.html|title=Charles Sobhraj - Crime Library on truTV.com|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ajay2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stararticle.com/article_112081_Hunt-still-on-for-Sobhrajs-partner-in-crime.html|title=Hunt still on for Sobhraj's partner in crime|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj and Chowdhury committed their first (known) murders in 1975. Most of the victims had spent some time with the duo before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join the pair in their crimes. Sobhraj claimed that most of his murders were really accidental [[drug overdose]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65vK_gbsgwI}}&lt;/ref&gt; but investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim was a young woman from [[Seattle]]. Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book ''Serpentine'') was found drowned in a tidal pool in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], wearing a flowered [[bikini]]. It was only months later that Knowlton's [[autopsy]], as well as [[forensic science|forensic evidence]], proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident,&lt;ref name=natgeovid&gt;{{cite web|last=Cissel|first=Jim|title=Charles Sobhraj – The Serpent (Serial Killer Documentary)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNAsPISleMM|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was murder.

The next victim was a young [[nomad]]ic [[Sephardic Jew]], Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body was found on the road to the [[Pattaya]] resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] students Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fiancée Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="mammoth"/&gt; They, like many others, were poisoned by Sobhraj, who then nurtured them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim's French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend's disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled the couple out. Their bodies were found [[strangulation|strangled]] and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar-styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj's earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of both women were not connected by investigations at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the nickname "The Bikini Killer."&lt;ref name="mammoth"/&gt;

On 18 December, the day the bodies of Bintanja and Hemker were identified, Sobhraj and Leclerc entered [[Nepal]] using the deceased pair's passports. They met in Nepal and, on 21–22 December, murdered Laurent Carrière, 26 (from Canada), and Connie Bronzich, 29 (from the [[United States|U.S.]]); the two victims were incorrectly identified in some sources as Laddie DuParr and Annabella Tremont. Sobhraj and Leclerc returned to Thailand, using their latest victims' passports before their bodies could be identified. Upon his return to Thailand, Sobhraj discovered that his three French companions had started to suspect him of serial murder, having found documents belonging to the murder victims. Sobhraj's former companions then fled to Paris after notifying local authorities.&lt;ref name="mammoth"&gt;''The Mammoth Book of Gangs'', Mammoth Books, Running Press (26 June 2012); {{ISBN|0762444363}}/{{ISBN|978-0762444366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj's next destination was either [[Varanasi]] or [[Calcutta]], where he murdered [[Israel]]i scholar Avoni Jacob simply to obtain Jacob's passport. Sobhraj used the passport to travel with Leclerc and Chowdhury – first to [[Singapore]], then to India, and, in March 1976, returning to [[Bangkok]], despite knowing that the authorities there sought him. The clan was interrogated by Thai policemen in connection with the murders, but released because authorities feared that the negative publicity accompanying a murder trial would harm the country's tourist industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Meanwhile, Dutch [[diplomat]] Herman Knippenberg was investigating the murders of Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met, Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With the help of a neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. He was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was [[Malaysia]], where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving [[Malaysia]] to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="ajay1"/&gt; A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in [[West Germany]], but the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.&lt;ref name="ajay2"/&gt;

Soon back in Asia, Sobhraj started to build a new criminal "family," starting with two lost Western women, Barbara Smith and Mary Ellen Eather, in [[Bombay]]. Sobhraj's next victim was a Frenchman, Jean-Luc Solomon, whose poisoning during a robbery, simply intended to incapacitate him, left him dead.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In July 1976 in [[New Delhi]], Sobhraj, joined by his three-woman criminal clan, tricked a tour group of French [[post-graduate]] students into accepting them as tour guides. Sobhraj then drugged them by giving them poisoned pills, which he told them were anti-dysentery medicine. When the drugs took effect more quickly than Sobhraj had anticipated, the students began to fall unconscious. Three of the students realized what Sobhraj had done. They overpowered him and contacted the police, leading to his capture. During interrogation, Sobhraj's accomplices, Smith and Eather, quickly buckled and confessed. Sobhraj was charged with the murder of Solomon, and all four were sent to [[Tihar Jail|Tihar prison]], New Delhi while awaiting formal trial.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Prison time==
Smith and Eather attempted suicide in prison during the two years before their trial. Sobhraj had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in [[bribery|bribing]] captors and living comfortably in jail. He turned his trial into a spectacle, hiring and firing lawyers at whim, bringing in his recently [[parole]]d brother André to assist, and eventually going on a [[hunger strike]]. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Leclerc was found guilty of drugging the French students, but was later paroled and returned to Canada when she developed [[ovarian cancer]]. She was still claiming her innocence and was reportedly still loyal to Sobhraj when she died at her home in April 1984.&lt;!-- age?? --&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

Sobhraj's systematic bribery of prison guards at Tihar reached outrageous levels. He led a life of luxury inside the jail, with television and gourmet food, having befriended both guards and prisoners. He gave interviews to Western authors and journalists, such as ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine's [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]] in the late 1970s, and Alan Dawson in 1984. He freely talked about his murders, while never actually admitting to them, and pretended that his actions were in retaliation against "Western [[imperialism]]" in Asia.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

When Sobhraj's sentence was to end, the twenty-year Thai arrest [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] against him would still have been valid, thereby affecting his [[extradition]] and almost certain [[Execution (legal)|execution]]. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, Sobhraj threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills and walked out of the jail. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in [[Goa]]; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

==Celebrity and re-capture==
Sobhraj retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris. He hired a publicity agent and charged large sums of money for interviews and photographs. He is said to have charged over $US15 million (according to advocate and former police inspector Bishwa Lal Shrestha, who investigated the case, framed the charge sheet and registered the case in court) for the rights to a movie based on his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3867791.stm|title=The 'bikini-killer' linked to murders throughout Asia|accessdate=27 September 2009|work=BBC News|date=12 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2003, Sobhraj was seen in a street of [[Kathmandu]] by a journalist. The journalist quickly reported this to the Nepalese authorities, who arrested him two days later in the [[casino]] of the Yak and Yeti hotel. Sobhraj's motives for returning to Nepal remain unknown. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] by the Kathmandu district court on 20 August 2004 for the murders of Bronzich and Carrière in 1975. Most of the photocopy evidence used against him in this case was from that gathered by Knippenberg, the Dutch diplomat, and [[Interpol]]. He appealed against the [[conviction (law)|conviction]], claiming that he was sentenced without trial. His lawyer also announced that Chantal, Sobhraj's wife in France, was filing a case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against the [[Government of France|French government]] for refusing to provide him with any assistance. Sobhraj's conviction was confirmed by the Patan [[Court of Appeals]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Current status==
In late 2007, news media reported that Sobhraj's lawyer had appealed to the then [[President of France|French president]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], for intervention with Nepal. In 2008, Sobhraj announced his engagement to a Nepali woman Nihita Biswas (who later participated in the reality show ''[[Bigg Boss]]''). On 7 July 2008, issuing a press release through his fiancée Nihita, he claimed that he was never convicted of murder by any court and asked the media not to refer to him as a [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2008/07/id/2845|title=Press Release of Charles Shobhraj|publisher=Mysansar|accessdate=28 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724043528/http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2008/07/id/2845|archive-date=24 July 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was claimed that Sobhraj married his fiancée on 9 October 2008 in jail on [[Dashain#Dashami|Bada Dashami]], a Nepalese festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Charles_Sobhraj_weds_Nepalese_girlfriend/rssarticleshow/3577773.cms|title=Charles Sobhraj ties the knot with Nihita Biswas|publisher=The Times of India|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, Nepalese jail authorities dismissed the claim of his marriage. They said that Nihita and her family had been allowed to conduct a [[Tilaka|tika]] ceremony, along with the relatives of hundreds of other prisoners. They further claimed that it was not a wedding but part of the ongoing [[Dashain]] festival, when elders put the [[Bindi (decoration)|vermilion mark]] on the foreheads of those younger to them to signify their blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-10-10/rest-of-world/27934181_1_charles-sobhraj-kathmandu-s-central-jail-bikini-killer|title=Sobhraj wedding a farce: Nepal jail authorities|publisher=The Times of India|date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] postponed the verdict on an appeal filed by Sobhraj against a district court's verdict sentencing him to life imprisonment for the murder of American backpacker Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. Sobhraj had appealed against the district court's verdict in 2006, calling it unfair and accusing the judges of racism while handing out the sentence.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On 30 July 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict issued by the district court in Kathmandu of a life sentence for the murder of Connie Jo Bronzich and another year, plus a Rs 2,000 fine for entering Nepal illegally. The seizure of all Sobhraj's properties was also ordered by the court. Sobhraj’s “wife” Nihita and “mother-in-law” Shakuntala Thapa, a lawyer, expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict, with Thapa claiming that Sobhraj had been "denied" justice and that the "judiciary is corrupt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/08/id/12461|title=Video of Shakuntala Thapa claiming "judiciary is corrupt|publisher=Mysansar|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217030945/http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/08/id/12461|archive-date=17 December 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged and sent to judicial custody&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=SC+orders+judicial+custody+for+Nihita%2C+Shakuntala&amp;NewsID=252290|title=SC orders judicial custody for Nihita, Shakuntala|publisher=The Himalayan Times|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[contempt of court]] because of these remarks.

On 18 September 2014, Sobhraj was convicted in tBhaktapur district court of the murder of Canadian tourist Laurent Carrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29261120|title=Nepal court convicts 'Bikini killer' Charles Sobhraj of second murder|publisher=BBC News|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Sobhraj was in [[critical condition]], and had been operated on multiple times. He has received several [[open heart surgery|open heart surgeries]], and is scheduled for more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/special/when-i-kept-charles-sobhraj-alive/20181218.htm|title=Testimony of a Surgeon Operating on Charles Sobhraj|publisher=Rediff News|author=Dr Raamesh Koirala|date=18 December 2018|accessdate= 30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/newstopics/charles-sobhraj.html|title='Bikini Killer' Charles Sobhraj Critical in Hospital, Says Mother-In-Law|publisher=News 18|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Sobhraj has been the subject of two nonfiction books, ''Serpentine'' (1979) by [[Thomas Thompson (American author)|Thomas Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas |date=1979 |title=Serpentine |location=New York |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=9780385130172 |author-link=Thomas Thompson (American author) |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/serpentine00thom }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobrhaj'' (1980) by [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]] and Julie Clarke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Neville |first1=Richard |last2=Clarke |first2=Julie |date=1980 |title=The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobrhaj |location=Sydney |publisher=Pan Books |isbn=0-330-27144-X |author-link1=Richard Neville (writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neville and Clarke's book was the basis for a 1989 made-for-TV movie, ''[[Shadow of the Cobra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098299/|title=Shadow of the Cobra (TV Movie 1989)|date=18 July 1989|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On the TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'', the character of [[Nicole Wallace]], portrayed by [[Olivia d'Abo]], is loosely based on Marie-Andrée Leclerc. In the episode "[[Slither (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent episode)|Slither]]" (which was originally to be titled "Serpentine"), [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] appears as Bernard Fremont, Wallace's mentor and former partner-in-crime, who is based on Sobhraj.

'''Darbara Singh''' (1943/1944 or 1952 – 6 June 2018) was an Indian serial killer, who has been convicted for two murders.

During April–October 2004, 23 children of non-[[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] migrants were kidnapped in the [[Jalandhar]] city of [[Punjab, India]]. Many of these children were sexually assaulted, and 17 of them were killed. In October, the police apprehended Darbara Singh, who had earlier been jailed for nearly a decade in another case involving sexual assault and attempted murder on a child. Singh allegedly confessed that he was behind all these abductions, sexual assaults and murders in 2004. He was convicted for two of the murders, and sentenced to life in prison. He was also convicted for two more murders; in this case, he had led the police to dead bodies after his arrest. He was given a death sentence in this case, but was later acquitted by the High Court because of insufficient evidence. He was also acquitted in four more cases because of insufficient evidence. He died in 2018, while serving a life sentence, with some of the cases pending for trial.

== Early life ==

Darbara Singh is a native of Jallupur Khera village of [[Amritsar district]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt; He joined the Indian Armed Forces, and was posted at the Air Force Station at [[Pathankot]]. In 1975, he was accused of lobbing a [[hand grenade]] at the house of his senior officer Major V K Sharma, after having an altercation with him. The wife and teenaged son of the officer were seriously injured in the attack. Singh was dismissed and arrested; however, he was acquitted after a trial.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/print/news/india-s-cruel-serial-baby-killer-darbara-singh-who-murdered-2674-98.html |title=India's cruel serial baby killer Darbara Singh, who murdered 17 babies |publisher=India TV  |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh had three children; his wife expelled him from their house, because of his "bad habits".&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

In 1996, Darbara Singh raped and attempted to murder the daughter of a migrant labourer in [[Kapurthala]]. In 1997, he was convicted in three cases of rape and attempt to murder, and sentenced to prison for 30 years. From Kapurthala he was shifted to the Jalandhar Central Jail, and then to the Ludhiana Central Jail. On 3 December 2003, his mercy petition was accepted on the basis of his good conduct, and he was released from the jail. By this time, he had developed a grudge against migrants, holding them responsible for wasting many years of his life.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2008/01/07/death-sentence-to-child-serial-killer-in-punjab-1199776446.html |title=Death sentence to child serial killer in Punjab |date=2008-01-08 |publisher=One India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, he came to Jalandhar, where he started working in a factory in the Leather Complex area. He lived in a rented room in the Model House locality. To take his 'revenge' against the migrants, he started targeting their children.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt;

== Modus operandi ==

Singh lured his victims with [[South Asian sweets|sweets]], [[samosa]]s, [[sugarcane juice]], and crackers. He took them to a secluded place, where he would attack the victim. In most cases, he slit their throat, and attempted to rape their dead bodies. After his arrest, he said that he raped the dead bodies so that "there would be no shrieks of victims".&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

He preferred time to kidnap the children was between 10 am and 12.30 pm, when most of migrant labourers were away in factories.&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

After his arrest, he said that he was not drunk at the time of committing crimes, but afterwards, "celebrated almost each of the killings with liquor and good food".&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

== Alleged victims ==

During  a period of 7 months, 23 children, most of them below the age of 10, went missing from Kapurthala city. Of them, six were recovered by the police. Darbara Singh admitted that he had killed the other 17 victims, including 15 girls and 2 boys. He subjected many of the dead bodies to rape or sodomy.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt; He said that he had dumped most of the bodies near a bridge on the Rayya-Khadoor Sahib road.&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

Singh targeted children of non-Punjabi migrants. He killed one Punjabi girl by mistake, and after his arrest, said that he had been "shaken" by her death.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

There, he made Asha sit on one side of the canal. He took Diksha behind the bushes, and raped her. A frightened Asha ran away from the place, while Diksha was killed. Meanwhile, when the two girls did not return for a long time, their cousins returned home and informed the family. The family searched for the girls, and then registered a missing persons complaint. Later, a man named Malkiat Singh found Asha in Fazilpur village in Tarn Taran district. He gave her biscuits and medicines, and then brought her to the [[Khadoor Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency)|Khadoor Sahib]] police station. The police control room then informed the Jalandhar police station that a girl named Ashu had been found in Tarn Taran. Later, the police found Diksha's naked dead body lying on a big stone near Bahadurpur Uppal canal. A post-mortem conducted on 21 April revealed that she had died because of "[[neurogenic shock]] as a result of injuries to private part".&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Darbara Singh vs State Of Punjab |court=Punjab and Haryana High Court |date=2013-02-20 |url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143465181/ |accessdate=2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040421/punjab1.htm#23 |title=Missing girl's body found |date=2004-04-21 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest ==

By September 2004, panic had spread among the local residents. In the preceding 4 months, 14 children had been kidnapped with no ransom demands, and 10 of them were still missing. The chopped arm of a child was found near [[Wariana|Variana]], and the partly decomposed body of a 10-year-old girl was found in [[Chaheru]]. The police were looking for "a middle-aged cycle borne suspect, who is probably mentally challenged".&lt;ref name="Tribune_panic_2004"/&gt;

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) analyzed the killer's modus operandi and prepared his sketch based on information gathered from different sources. On the morning of 29 October 2004, the police received information about a bicyclist, who resembled the sketch and was seen with a bag of toffees. [[Station house officer|SHO]] Pritam Singh was despatched to nab the person, who turned out to be Darbara Singh.&lt;ref name="Tribune_held_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041030/main3.htm |title=Serial baby killer held |date=2008-10-30 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the police party intercepted him near Bastian, Singh threw away his bicycle and tried to run away. The police apprehended them and questioned him, following which he confessed his crimes.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"/&gt;

According to the police, Darbara confessed to having targeted 23 children, out of whom he killed 17. However, the police suspect that the actual number of victims could be more. Their suspicion was based on similar abductions in Kapurthala district and recovery of two more mutilated bodies of babies in jungles of Jallupur Khera village of Amritsar district.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

Nishu, who had escaped from his clutches on 22 October, identified him from his pictures in newspapers.&lt;ref name="Tribune_leads_2004"/&gt; Ilaqa Magistrate K.K. Kareer remanded him in 10 days' police custody. After his medical examination and court appearance, Darbara Singh led the police to a place near Kadianwali village. There, the police found bodies of two victims, Khursheed and Ronku, who had been killed on 25 October.&lt;ref name="Tribune_leads_2004"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041031/main5.htm |title=Serial killer leads cops to bodies of 2 victims |date=2004-10-30 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrest, Darbara Singh showed no remorse, even when he was taken to the sites where he had dumped the dead bodies. He told the police that he could have killed more children, if he had not been arrested "so soon". He said that he had no remorse for killing the children of migrant labourers, as they were instrumental in sending him to jail. He also added that he targeted a Punjabi girl by mistake, and had to kill her because "she could have created problems" for him; he said that he was "a bit shaken" by this. He contradicted himself, by first saying, "I still think whatever I did was right and it was the demand of the time", but then adding "I think what was done by me was wrong and I promise that I would never do it again."&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune_held_2008"/&gt;

== Convictions and acquittals ==

After his arrest, Darbara Singh was charged in 18 cases of abduction, rape and murder. By the end of 2007, he was acquitted in three of these cases due to lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="ToI_nails_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Girls-testimony-nails-baby-killer/articleshow/2984280.cms |title=Girls' testimony nails baby killer |author=IP Singh |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2008, Judge Iqbal Singh Bajwa awarded him death sentence for murders of Khursheed and Ronku in 2004.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Dharm_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080108/main5.htm |title=Death for baby killer |author=Dharmendra Joshi |date=2008-01-08 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January, he was shifted from Jalandhar jail to the Patiala Central Jail for hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080110/punjab1.htm#11 |title=Baby serial killer shifted to Patiala jail |date=2008-01-10 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Varinder Singh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Singh was tried for raping and killing 8-year old Diskha on 18 April 2004. Her sister Asha and her two cousins identified Singh in the court. Singh's counsel claimed that he had been falsely implicated, and based his defence on the premise that the children were tutored witnesses.&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"/&gt; On 25 April 2008, Judge B.K Mehta of Jalandhar court sentenced him to life imprisonment .&lt;ref name="Tribune_Kusum_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080426/punjab1.htm#20 |title=Serial baby killer gets life term |date=2008-04-26 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Kusum Arora }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2009, Justice Mehtab Singh Gill and Justice Jitendra Chauhan of the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] reversed the death sentence awarded to Darbara Singh for murder of Khursheed and Ronku. Citing insufficient evidence, the Court acquitted Darbara Singh, giving benefit of the doubt.&lt;ref name="IE_moved_2010"/&gt; The prosecution had presented Jathedar Pritam Singh as a witness. Pritam claimed that he had recognized Darbara Singh at a police checkpost on 29 October 2004, leading to the latter's arrest. He also claimed to have seen Darbara Singh taking the two children away from Basti Mithu on a bicycle, on 25 October. Pritam stated that he was going towards Basti Mithu at the time. Once he reached Basti Mithu, he came to know that two children were missing from the area. He then rushed to the place where he had seen Darbara earlier, but did not find him or the children there. Although this incident happened on 25 October 2004, he did not report it to the police until 28 October. This was despite the fact that he was a member of [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali Dal]]'s working committee, and was well-aware of the child abduction incidents happening in the area. The Court, therefore, ruled that him out as a "planted witness". The prosecution had also presented Darbara Singh's fingerprints on a liquor bottle and glass, stating that these had two objects been recovered from the place where the dead bodies were found. In support, the prosecution had presented the testimonies of several policemen and the owner of the field where the bodies had been found. the Court pointed out that there was no mention of these objects in the inquest reports of Khursheed and Ronku. Besides, the police claimed to have recovered these objects on 30 October, but sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory only on 11 November. Therefore, the Court dismissed this piece of evidence, citing a 1997 Supreme Court judgment, which had ruled that the accused is entitled to acquittal if the fingerprints are kept in the police station for more than 5 days. The judge also questioned why the police had not taken any DNA or blood samples. He directed the police to adopt scientific methods instead of relying on "archaic methods of investigation".&lt;ref name="PHHC_138-DB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090731/cth2.htm#8 |title=HC: Shun archaic methods of probe |date=2009-07-31 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Saurabh Malik }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the Punjab government moved the Supreme Court, calling the High Court's decision as "wholly erroneous".&lt;ref name="IE_moved_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/sc-moved-against-acquittal-of-man-on-death-row/579263/0 |title=SC moved against acquittal of man on death row |newspaper=Indian Express |date=2010-02-13 |author=Raghav Ohri |location=Chandigarh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2010, Judge B S Sandhu acquitted him in Tazbin rape and murder case, because of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Bipin_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101211/punjab.htm#16 |title='Serial baby killer' acquitted in rape, murder case |author=Bipin Bhardwaj |newspaper=The Tribune |date=2010-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dainiktribuneonline.com/2010/12/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF/ |title=सबूतों के अभाव में बेबी किलर बरी |newspaper=Dainik Tribune |date=2010-12-11 |language=Hindi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darbara Singh was also convicted for kidnapping and causing life-threatening injury to Nishu. Nishu could not speak because of the throat injury, but she used expressions to identify Darbara Singh as her kidnapper and attacker. Guddi, a neighbour of Nishu, also testified that she had seen Darbara Singh standing with his bicycle in the area where the children were playing. Another man, Sham Lal, testified that he had seen Darbara Singh taking a young girl on the carrier of his bicycle in Isharwal village. Singh appealed against the conviction in the High Court, but his appeal was rejected.&lt;ref name="PHHC_D-11-DB"/&gt;

== Death ==
In 2018, Singh fell ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uniindia.com/~/serial-killer-of-23-children-of-jalandhar-dies-in-patiala-jail/States/news/1256950.html |title=Serial killer of 23 children of Jalandhar dies in Patiala jail |date=10 June 2018 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was moved from the prison to the [[Government Medical College, Patiala|Government Rajindra hospital]] in [[Patiala]] on 2 June. There, he died on 6 June; his family refused to claim his body, calling his crimes "unpardonable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/child-serial-killer-dies-at-75-family-refuses-to-claim-body/articleshow/64533207.cms |title=Child serial killer dies at 75, family refuses to claim body |author=Manish Sirhindi |newspaper=The Times of India |date=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satish''' (born c. 1973) is a convicted Indian pedophile and serial killer who was active in [[Bahadurgarh]] in [[Haryana]] from 1995 to 1998. He admitted kidnapping and attempting to rape fourteen girls, murdering ten. Police confirmed Satish's involvement in twelve cases, including the ten murders. Since his victims were all five to nine years of age, he is also known as the '''Bahadurgarh baby killer.'''

The police's inability to apprehend Satish led to protests and near-riots by local residents. Under pressure, police prosecuted three men in succession as the murders continued. Satish was finally arrested in 1998, when his final victim led police to him. He was convicted of twelve sexual assaults and ten murders, and is serving a life sentence.

== Early life ==

Satish came to Bahadurgarh from [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]] with his parents.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070116/haryana.htm#1 |title=Nithari-like case at Bahadurgarh |date=2007-01-16 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Yoginder Gupta }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at the home of his father, Brij Pal, in Bahadurgarh's Netaji Nagar section. When Satish was arrested in 1998, he was 25 years old.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

== {{anchor|Investigations}}Initial suspects ==

=== {{anchor|First false arrest: Raj Kumar}}Raj Kumar ===

Satish's first victim was Pooja, who was killed in February 1995. Since her father was employed by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Union Home Ministry]], the police were under pressure to apprehend the culprit quickly. They arrested Raj Kumar (also known as Raja), saying that he had confessed to the crime. Raja was cleared after being imprisoned for 18 months.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

in July 1995, while Raja was still in police custody, Satish raped and killed a seven-year-old girl. After Satish's third crime in September 1995, the police began looking for a serial killer. When the fourth girl was murdered in October 1995, angry local residents organized [[dharna]]s. Authorities transferred the local police superintendent and intensified patrolling in the area. The police asked parents to keep an eye on their children (especially young girls) and report any suspicious persons, but there was no progress in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Second false arrest: Ram Babu}}Ram Babu ===

In January 1996, Satish kidnapped and raped two girls in five days. Local residents intensified their protests, organizing [[bandh]]s, so the [[deputy inspector general of police]] (DGP) and the district [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SP) remained in Bahadurgarh to supervise the investigation. Police explored the possibility that the killer lived in neighbouring [[Delhi]], and involved the [[Delhi Police]] in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

The Delhi Police arrested the possibly-[[Intellectual disability|intellectually-disabled]] Ram Babu, claiming the {{INR}}50,000 reward announced by the Haryana police for the arrest of the "Bahadurgarh baby killer".&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; Babu, of [[Bihar]], was arrested at a [[dhaba|roadside restaurant]] on the Delhi-Rohtak road near [[Nangloi Jat|Nangloi]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_killed_1998"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug16/haryana.htm#9 |title=Serial killer killed in jail |date=1998-08-16 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murders continued, indicating that Babu was not the killer. On 16 August 1998, three months before Satish was caught and after spending thirty months in prison, 32-year-old Ram Babu was killed in prison. Om Prakash, another prisoner in the mental ward, hit him on the head with a brick and killed him.&lt;ref name="Tribune_killed_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IE_jail_1998"&gt;{{cite news |date=1998-08-17 |newspaper=Indian Express |title="Baby killer" murdered in jail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The senior superintendent of police (SSP) who interviewed Ram Babu later said:

{{quote|In his 30s, neither did he appear mentally deranged nor given to perversity. He kept smiling through his "interrogation" and did not admit to remorse, even after "confessing" to having murdered 70 women. But we could not make out whether he was lying. He didn't make any admissions except when given "suggestions". When prompted, he talked with so much ease about how he disposed of the bodies of his victims that one tended to disbelieve him. The peculiar thing about him was that he sang lewd songs. He would talk about sex and the mere mention of a certain film actress would make him blush and indulge in an "expressed gratification" using verbal rhymes and making "appropriate and overt" sexual gestures. We consulted psychiatrists, who rubbished our theory by saying that regular sexual fantasising, in an overt or covert way, does create a kind of catharsis — resulting in the person being less likely to commit sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/inside-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/20660/0 |title=Inside the mind of a serial killer |date=2007-01-11 |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== {{anchor|Third false arrest: Shankar Kumar}}Shankar Kumar ===

On 22 June 1997, Satish killed seven-year-old Manju. On 10 July the police arrested Shankar Kumar of [[Begusarai]] in Bihar, alleging that he had attempted to abduct Aarti (a young girl from Subhash Nagar in Bahadurgarh). According to Senior Superintendent of Police A. S. Chawla, Shankar admitted kidnapping and murdering Manju.&lt;ref name="IE_jail_1998"/&gt;

The arrest was again found premature when Satish raped and murdered nine-year-old Kinty, whose nude body was found on 8 October. Her discovery led to a violent public protest in Bahadurgarh the following day.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; In near-riot conditions, police opened fire on the crowd and two youths were killed. Nearby units of the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] were called in to assist local police,&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; and the case was transferred to the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CID]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; Because of the massive police presence in the city, Satish did not strike again for the next eleven months.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

== Arrest ==

After nearly a year of inactivity, in September 1998 Satish kidnapped a nine-year-old girl from her family's [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] at night. Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Suman Manjari organized a citizens' anti-crime committee to increase awareness and mobilize support for police efforts. She met with the local [[chamber of commerce]], who posted a {{INR}}10,000 reward for helping police catch the killer.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

On 18 November, Satish kidnapped six-year-old Somani when she was returning from her father's [[chaiwala|tea stall]]. Manjari supervised the search and the investigation, but could not make any headway.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; Satish raped Somani twice in his home; when she lost consciousness, he assumed she was dead and threw her into a field near his house.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

Two days later, Umid Singh saw Somani weeping in a dry [[flood control channel]] near a bridge. He asked the girl her name and address, but she would only tell him her name. Singh brought her to the Modern Industrial Area police station. The local police, realizing that she was a probable victim of the "baby killer", informed Manjari. Somani told her that she had been kidnapped by a dark-skinned bicyclist with a thin beard, and led police to the house across the train tracks where she was kept overnight.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; Satish's brother told police that he was at work at a tin factory, where he was arrested.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

After the arrest, the Haryana Police asked the Delhi Police to return the reward they had claimed. The Delhi Police returned the money, which was given to Somani.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

== Conviction ==

According to the police, Satish appeared to be a "mentally deranged sex pervert".&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; From 10 to 23 December 1998, he was observed by Dr. Rajiv Gupta at the [[Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[Rohtak]]. Gupta concluded that Satish was not [[Psychosis|psychotic]], but had a "[[neurosis|neurotic]] type of personality". Satish admitted committing 14 crimes, and on 22 December a magistrate determined that his confession was voluntary. Although Satish later [[Recantation|recanted]] his confession, he was convicted on the basis of evidence;&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt; the details he provided of the kidnappings, rapes and murders were corroborated by other evidence.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; In the Aarti murder case (victim number 11), he was questioned with lie-detection expert Dr. Bibha Rani on 1 December 1998 and his description of the crime matched the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

Satish was sentenced to life imprisonment; the court did not find his crime the "rarest of the rare", which would have given him a [[death sentence]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; In 2008, the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] rejected the [[government of Haryana]]'s request for a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Serial-killers-life-spared/articleshow/2722792.cms |title=Serial killer's life spared |date=2008-01-23 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled:

{{quote|In the present case, the accused is already in custody for 10 years. The trial court thought it fit not to impose death sentence. The offence committed is very heinous and though, it may be one of the rarest cases, after weighing all the circumstances, taking a 'global' view, we are of the view that extreme penalty of death sentence is not called for. However, while affirming life imprisonment, we direct that the accused will not be released from custody before completion of 20 years of actual sentence.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;}}

'''Zoltán Szabó''' (1968 – December 5, 2016 in [[Szeged]]), known as the '''Balástya Monster''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[serial killer]] who killed women for monetary purposes. He was convicted of killing four people out of his 5 confirmed murders, but could possibly have upwards of 6 victims.

== Early life ==
Szabó was born into a farmer's family in 1968, and had lived on a farm since his youth. He studied until the eight grade in elementary school, refusing to study any more. His father died early, and his brother who lived on the farm committed suicide. Szabó has already had a criminal record at the time of the murders, as he was convicted for the rape of a 60-year-old woman. He also behaved violently with his partner, who broke the relationship with him because of this. He then began living alone on his farm as a farmer and doing occasional farm work. In addition to this, he also participated in organizing seasonal workers from Romania during the agricultural season, finding work and accommodation for them. During the second half of the 1990s, the traffic near [[Balástya]] grew, as the civil war in [[Yugoslavia]] had recently ended and many passed through the 5th Highway along the settlement. The increasing turnover of the highway attracted businesses, criminals, merchants and prostitutes to the settlement, including some of Szabó's future victims.

== Confirmed murders ==
Szabó's first proven murder was of a woman working in a bar, with whom he met on April 28, 1998. He managed to persuade her to stay on his farm on the outskirts of Balástya. Upon their arrival, the woman was hit with a heavy object several times, dying from the severe head injuries. Szabó then dismembered his victim and buried her body in a pit 50 meters away from the farm, in which he also placed her clothes. The second murder took place in a similar fashion. Szabó met another woman whom he persuaded to come to his farm. When she came, he hit her with heavy object on the head and neck, with the woman dying from the heavy blows. The body was then dismembered and placed in the same pit as before, the only difference being that the second victim's head was never discovered.

In February 2000, on the pretext of joint theft of fire syringes, Szabó lured and killed Teresia K. The woman was strangled in an orchard, and was then mutilated and burned. Her clothes were never found either.

The fourt proven murder led to Szabó's downfall. In August 2001, he convinced a female dealer who used to sell cell phones that she would get a large amount of phones at a favorable price. The woman believed him, and on August 25 she collected 300,000 [[forint]]s from the bank. The woman then drove to Szabó's farm, where she was strangled by him not far from the place. The murderer then disposed of the evidence and the woman's small motorbike in a nearby water hole. However, the authorities were closely monitoring the disappearances, and when the phone dealer disappeared, they searched through her call lists, where they found Zoltán Szabó's number. When questioned, he confessed to the murder. Later on, when more corpses were discovered, he confessed to these murders as well.

== Unconfirmed murders ==
On August 25, 1998, Szabó supposedly forced prostitute Mónika K. to leave the 5th Highway car park and go to his farm. There, he strangled her in a nearby orchard and dragged the body to a track near the [[Cegléd-Szeged railway]] line. Subsequently, a [[freight train]] and two other trains ran over the body, completely crushing it. Although Szabó was last seen in her company, the court could not definitely prove that he was the culprit, and he was not convicted of Mónika K.'s murder.

Szabó also mentioned a sixth murder, which he claimed to have not committed but simply knew of. The investigators doubted his claim of innocence, but the post-mortum investigation proved ineffective, and so this case was included in the indictment.

The police investigator who headed the investigation also stated that he was certain Szabó was responsible for more murders. The detective, referring to a witness' testimony, wrote that Szabó was responsible for the disappearances of a Romanian family of five. He was so confident of his opinion that he offered 500,000 forints to Szabó for each new corpse he showed the location to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20051205milliokat.html|title=The case of the Balástya murders was reopened|publisher=Origo|date=5 December 2005|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation, trial and prison ==
After Szabó's capture, extensive research began for the killer's victims. Following his testimony, the surrounding area was searched, and in the specified places, excavations of an unprecedentead scale, almost of landscaping, began. During the search, four corpses from Szabó's testimonies were located, but no remnants of other murders were found. Despite this, the prosecution suspected him of murdering five women.

The [[Csongrád County]] court, hearing the case at first instance, found Zoltán Szabó guilty of all four murders and sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.ma.hu/tart/rcikk/a/0/65744/1|title=Lifetime Imprisonment is the deserved punishment of "Balástya's Nightmare"|publisher=ma.hu|date=20 November 2003|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2004, the Szeged Court Judge sentenced to life imprisonment for a final time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20040910eletfogytiglant.html|title=The Balástyan Nightmare is a lifesaver|publisher=Origo|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/pipas_pista_a_mi_drakulank/2442732/|title=Pipás Pista is our Dracula|publisher=South Hungary|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trial Chamber could not find any evidence that Szabó's murders involved sexual aberration, and there was no mention of this ''other despicable reason'' in the judgment.

'''Alfredo Stranieri''' (born 30 July 1956 in [[Italy]], [[naturalized]] in 1982), known as the "'''Classified Ads Killer'''", is an Italian-born [[France|French]] criminal and [[serial killer]], who met his victims through [[classified ads]] in which he presented himself as a potential buyer of properties or used cars.

He would kill his victims and appropriate their property. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] together with a minimum sentence of 22 years on 28 February 2003 for four murders and one unsuccessful attempted murder. Stranieri had appropriated the property of the two couples he had murdered to use it in fraudulent activities, also trying to kill a man who wanted to sell him a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].

== Crimes ==

=== First double murder ===
Near the end of 1997, Stranieri responded to an ad published by a couple of restaurateurs, Frédéric Adman and his companion Nathalie Girard, who wanted to a nightclub in [[Viry-Châtillon]] called the ''New Love''. On 7 November 1997 the sale was signed, and six days later, the couple disappeared.&lt;ref name="Pradel"&gt;[[:fr:Jacques Pradel|Jacques Pradel]], « Alfredo Stranieri, le tueur aux petites annonces », émission ''L'heure du crime'' sur RTL, 16 janvier 2013{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted murder ===
On 4 January 1999 Stranieri, under the [[pseudonym]] of his first murder victim Frédéric Adman, contacted Simon Cohen through an advertisement for his Jaguar. Curiously, without seeing the vehicle or negotiating about its price, Stranieri offered Cohen to finalize the transaction in his restaurant/nightclub ''New Lover ''in Viry-Châtillon. When Cohen arrived, Stranieri told him that a friend would come and bring him the check certified by the bank to pay for the car. He then coaxed his victim by offering to visit the premises while waiting for the check, to which Cohen reluctantly agreed.&lt;ref name="Michel"&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 years of Criminal Affairs|author=Pascal Michel|date=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stranieri then pulled out a .[[22 LR]] Carbine and, in the dim light, fired 5 times at Cohen, but the man managed to escape to the neighbor's house by climbing the fence. The neighbor then called the police, while Stranieri fled. Simon Cohen was transported to the emergency and rescued after 4 hours of surgery.

The police opened an investigation into the nightclub's owner and discovered that Alfredo Stranieri already had a criminal record for scams and car trafficking. They then went to his home in [[Soisy-sur-Seine]], where his wife Anne-Marie expected that her husband would arrive early, but never did, and the police lost his trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scenedecrime.blogs.com/scenedecrime/2007/10/laffaire-alfred.html L'affaire Alfredo Stranieri 17 octobre 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaguar case, told in just a few lines at a local newspaper, drew the attention of the Girard couple, whose daughter Nathaliem and her companion Frédéric Adman had disappeared suddenly on 10 November 1997. They were running a restaurant called ''Oasis ''in Viry-Châtillon, which had since became ''New Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/1999/07/21/quatre-cadavres-avec-preuves-d-achat-ce-sont-les-ex-proprietaires-des-commerces-rachetes-par-stranie_279306|title=Four corpses with proof of purchase. These are the former owners of the shops bought by Stranieri|author=Olivier Bertrand|publisher=liberation.fr|date=21 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second double murder ===
In March 1999, in [[Aveyron]], he selected a classified ad for an inn in [[Naussac, Aveyron|Naussac]] called ''La Bouriatte. ''The place was to his taste: luxurious and isolated, and the bill was signed on 10 April 1999. Two days later, Nicole Rousseau and Claude Mouly, the two owners who were in the process of a divorce, disappeared. Alfredo, who introduced himself under the name of Mario Stranieri (thanks to the identity card of his brother, which he had borrowed) and claimed to be the manager of a large nightclub in the [[Paris]] area, accepted the purchase for 4 million francs without negotiating and moved to Bouriatte, while Rousseau and Mouly mysteriously disappeared.

== Arrest and incarceration ==
Corinne Mouly, worried about not hearing from her father, moved in front of the hostel to spy on Stranieri and alerted the [[gendarmes]]. The investigators, under the direction of the commander of the gendarmes in Aveyron, Colonel Gery Plane, then discovered that Stranieri was wanted for the attempted murder of Simon Cohen. "Mario" Stranieri was arrested on 7 July 1999 by the gendarmes in [[Capdenac]].&lt;ref name="Michel"/&gt; The case was entrusted to the Évry research brigade and teams were deployed to search for the bodies of the deceased in Naussac. On 19 July 1999 the police exhumed the bodies of Girard and Adman in the garden of the ''New Love ''nightclub and on the next day, the gendarmes exhumed those of Rousseau and Mouly near ''La Bouriatte''.&lt;ref name="Dejean"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/02/17/191050-alfredo-stranieri-est-il-un-serial-killer.html|title=Alfredo Stranieri, is he a serial killer?|author=Marc Dejean|publisher=[[La Dépêche du Midi]]|date=17 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspected of being an accomplice in his scams, Stranieri's wife Anne-Marie was incarcerated in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1999/12/24/232974-est-elle-complice-d-alfredo.html|title=Is she an accomplice of Alfredo?

== Trial and sentence ==
Alfredo Stranieri's trial began in the [[assize court]] of [[Essonne]] on 18 February 2003. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 28 February 2003, with a 22-year security sentence. The conviction was confirmed in March 2004 by the [[Créteil]] Court of Appeals. Stranieri's appeal in 2005 was rejected by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/586187-Societe-Retour-sur-une-affaire-criminelle-2-5-Alfredo-Stranieri-le-coucou.php|title=Back on the criminal case: Alfredo Stranieri, "the Cuckoo"|publisher=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]]|date=26 July 2010|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421122427/http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/586187-Societe-Retour-sur-une-affaire-criminelle-2-5-Alfredo-Stranieri-le-coucou.php|archive-date=21 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in prison ==
Alfredo Stranieri and Germain Gaiffe both appeared before the 6th Criminal Chamber in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] on 11 March 2011 for "disrespect". For months, Stranieri claimed to be the father of the daughter of the former Minister of Justice, [[Rachida Dati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/article/685204/societe-les-deux-assassins-revaient-amant-dati-vont-etre-juges|title=The two murderers who dreamed of being Dati's lover will be judged|publisher=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]]|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case dates back to September 2010. Stranieri, sentenced to life imprisonment for killing and burying four people in gardens, and Germain Gaiffe, sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for killing and dismembering a man, both posted an identical letter from the [[Poissy]] prison, addressed to the hall of the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]]. Both claimed to the father of Rachida Dati's daughter and enclosed a declaration of paternity. Warned by the prison services, the public prosecutor's office decided to seize the case and prosecute them for "insulting the person in charge of public authority". Dati soon became a civil party. At a hearing, Gaiffe wore a provocative sweater on which "I am the father of Zohra" was written. When questioned, the two men explained that they had shared a moment of intimacy in a room with the minister who came to visit their prison in December 2007, more than a year before she gave birth.

On 17 July 2013 Stranieri married Gaiffe. The wedding, delivered by Frédérik Bernard, mayor of Poissy, took place in the presence of their respective witnesses, the terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal]] and the comedian [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]] at the Central House of Poissy in [[Yvelines]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.20minutes.fr/article/1189551/ynews1189551 "Dieudonné and the terrorist Carlos witness the marriage of two detainees], ''20 Minutes'', 17 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné had met the two criminals in the prison workshop while writing sketches. ''[[Libération]] ''commented that it is "unlikely that is a marriage of love", and saw it rather as a "new provocation of the comedian, organized with some comrades".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/07/17/mariage-homosexuel-en-prison-avec-carlos-et-dieudonne-pour-temoins_9189688|title=In prison, gay marriage mocked|publisher=[[Libération]]|date=17 July 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nadir Sedrati '''(born 1938) nicknamed "The Cutter of the Canal", is a [[France|French]] [[serial killer]] born to [[Algeria]]n parents. He was sentenced for the murders of three people committed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1817/articles/a22711-sedrati_le_voleur_de_vies.html "Sedrati the thief of lives"] Article of September 2, 1999 published in [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Nouvel_Observateur Le Nouvel Observateur] number 1817.&lt;/ref&gt; The various pieces of two bodies (the third body was never found) were thrown into the [[Marne-Rhine Canal]] near [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. In his judicial career, he was involved in five disappearances and sentenced for three murders.

== Facts and the investigation ==

=== The first body ===
In May 1999 a fisherman discovered a human right foot in the [[Canal de jonction de Nancy]]. He immediately informed the river police, who at first thought that the foot had been severed by a boat propeller. The next day, a putrefied human head was retrieved 500 meters away from the spot where the foot had been discovered.

A few days later bones, a [[sternum]], ribs and a third patella (that is to say, there was a second victim) that were fished in the vicinity of the canal. The next day a hand was discovered near the Nancy canal; finally, one week after the  discovery (the right human foot), the left foot was retrieved by the River Police. The medical examiner responsible for collecting the various pieces of the human body found that the limbs were sectioned surgically and excluded the hypothesis of an accident: it was therefore a homicide.

The police could not take fingerprint from the found hand because it was too badly decomposed. The River Brigade Police sent their hand to be analyzed in [[Paris]] where the only section of research are able to solve this type of problem. A few weeks later the laboratory managed to put a name to the found hand: Hans Gassen, a [[Germany|German]] who had served a prison sentence and who had been released a few months previously.

Police learned that Gassen was living in the house of another German who was also a former prisoner named Hans Muller. Muller had reported Gassen's disappearance on May 21, 1999, one week before the discovery of the dismembered body in the canal.

At the same time, the police learned that Gassen received a lot of phone calls from two locations: a house in Nancy and an apartment near Nancy. During a search of both places the authorities discovered that a certain Philippe Grossiord regularly called Gassen and that Grossiord was an alias used by a man called Nadir Sedrati to avoid apprehension. Nadir Sedrati was known to the police since he had been arrested for fraud and identity theft and had shared a cell with Gassen and Muller. Sedrati was released from prison in March 1999, after both him and Gassen were both arrested for a confrontation. Muller declared that Hans Gassen left his home at 4 AM because he had an appointment on May 21. Gassen had to call back, but he never did. The phone calls proved that Muller was at home at the time of the disappearance of his friend, clearing him as a suspect. As for Sedrati, he said that it was Muller who killed Gassen during a dispute that went wrong: he declared that Muller, Gassen, two Dutchmen and two Moroccans were at home to discuss business (a supposed trafficking) and that he had left because that affair did not concern him; he then supposedly heard Gassen and Muller argue violently and saw Muller kill Gassen.

French and German police did not believe him and searched Sedrati's house. In his apartment they discovered a [[woodchipper]], a kitchen knife, a butcher's saw and several brownish spots on the floor, the sink and woodchipper. The police thought it was blood but had no proof of it. And by digging deeper into the apartment they realized that a bag is hidden in a cushion. The bag contained a jar filled with white powder and police believed it was drugs (either cocaine or heroin). A few weeks later the police learned that the white powder collected from Sedrati is cyanide, which suggested that Sedrati poisoned Gassen with cyanide (the police also discovered that Sedrati bought 20&amp;nbsp;kg of cyanide under the identity of a certain Joel Royer). The police began to catch a glimpse of what happened to Sedrati: Gassen had an appointment with Philippe Grossiord but it was Nadir Sedrati who received it. Sedrati had to tell Gassen that he had to wait for Grossiord; this last coming Sedrati have proposed to Gassen to have a cup of coffee mixed with cyanide. Gassen suffocated, fainted and somebody (presumably Sedrati) dismembered his body, whose various pieces were thrown into the canal.

But what puzzled the authorities is that Gassen's head was in a state of advanced decomposition. They thought that the head was thrown into the canal 6 weeks ago while Gassen had died 2 to 3 weeks ago. Digging again in Sedrati's apartment they discovered in the basement lime and learned that the lime can delay the identification of a body when a part of the body was immersed in it, whereas Gassen's head seemed more rotten for the others.

Nadir Sedrati was brought before the investigating judge and was subsequently imprisoned. He claimed he was innocent and the police discovered that Sedrati had no apparent motive to kill Gassen if not for the money, because Sedrati had stolen the victim's bank card to make some withdrawals (300 francs).

=== The second body ===
Police now had to solve the mystery of the third patella found at the same time as Gassen's pieces. They learned that Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, two other killers who knew Nadir Sedrati, have been missing since spring 1999. The police thought that either Steil or Ronfort was the second victim found in the canal. For this, they decided appeal to the family of the missing men to take a DNA sample. This was complicated, but the police still managed to collect the DNA of two people (a close friend of Steil and a close friend of Ronfort). Pending the results, the investigation showed that Gérard Steil was released from prison in October 1998 and that he found work for six months in Strasbourg as a delivery driver and housed in a home in the city.

His contract soon expired, but Steil still planned to work under a certain Philippe Grossiord, who had contacted him for work within his company Inter Europe Diffusion. Gérard Steil made the trip by train from Strasbourg to Nancy for the job interview, where he must have been with Grossiord and had to be back in Strasbourg on Monday morning. Steil arrived at the company, which turned out to be a fictional company invented by Grossiord (AKA Sedrati). The company's headquarters were located in a room at the back of Nadir Sedrati's apartment.

Then Sedrati called the home in which Steil lodged and that he would not come back because he started work in society. The police quickly concluded that Sedrati killed Steil. However the motive for the crime was unknown but the police believed that only interest for Sedrati to kill Steil was the poor pension that affected the victim. Moreover, the second patella belonged to Steil, so the police and the River Brigade of Nancy decided to drain the whole canal to find possible remains. In November 1999, remains were recovered in the canal and actually belonged to Gérard Steil.

=== A third victim? ===
Moreover, Norbert Ronfort, another acquaintance of Sedrati who disappeared just like Steil, left prison in early 1999 and had a goal: get in touch with his family and buy a motorhome. The police also learned that Ronfort had told Nadir Sedrati about his plans and that he received a phone call from Inter Europe Diffusion. The company boasted about selling motorhomes and, attracted by the offer of a certain Philippe Grossiord, Ronfort had agreed to meet him to acquire the motorhome. Since this conversation, Norbert Ronfort disappeared and his body still hasn't been found.

Nadir Sedrati was indicted in the murder of Hans Gassen, Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, even though his body was never found.

The trial of Nadir Sedrati began in April 2002 and lasted several days. Sedrati still proclaiming his innocence. The blood found on the linoleum and on the sink made it possible to confirm that Sedrati had killed his victim(s) in the kitchen.

Sedrati was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 20-year lock-in period. He tried to appeal this conviction.

== Second trial ==
Nadir Sedrati's second appeal trial opened in May 2003. In this second trial, Sedrati seemed tired and sad. A dramatic twist occurred: a jailed woman who knew Norbert Ronfort claimed to have seen him in 2000 (one year after Sedrati's arrest). A bailiff was sworn in to question this woman about what she knew. The young woman claimed to know Norbert Ronfort and claimed that they had crossed paths in 2000. Her testimony seemed coherent and in good faith. Norbert Ronfort's location then hovered over the Sedrati trial.

Psychiatric experts say Sedrati could re-offend anytime. Moreover, he usurped the identity of two other missing persons (one in 1985 and another in 1995) and was accused of murdering them. The bodies of these two people have not been found to date.

The jury did not take into account the testimony of the imprisoned woman and resentenced Nadir Sedrati to life imprisonment with a 22-year lock-in period.

Sedrati appealed in cassation. His appeal was dismissed in October 2003.

'''Giuseppe Sasia''' (born May 26, 1886 - February 17, 1936), known as '''The Shepherds' Killer''' and '''The Haut-Var Killer''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and [[serial killer]], who, in the span of several months in 1934, killed at least 4 men in [[Draguignan]], [[France]], with the aim of stealing from them. He was later [[guillotine]]d for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-temps/9-decembre-1934/123/649815/3|title=The Time (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Giuseppe Sasia arrived in France at the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-populaire/8-decembre-1934/110/1189579/1|title=Le Populaire (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 10.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal/6-novembre-1935/100/407255/5|title=Le Petit Journal (November 6, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an Italian farmer who settled in the country with his family. They moved to Les Arcs, and after his father's death, his mother returned to Italy, while he and his brother sold the family property.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k794918v|title=L'Intransigeant|last=|first=|date=November 5, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bought another farm with his brother, which they also sold at a big profit. Sasia then bought a restaurant in Les Arcs.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

Giuseppe is known to have committed theft several times, and sentenced for it four times.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5788851|title=Le Matin: last telegrams of the night|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasia lived in a small stone house in the middle of a field. He wasn't very sociable, and scared his neighbors, but nevertheless, he had a girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k628300t|title=Le Petit Parisien: daily newspaper of the evening|last=|first=|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for a while at a restaurant in Draguignan, a town where he went to buy ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-marseillais/9-decembre-1934/437/1804797/2|title=Le Petit Marseillais (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, he had an affair with a woman from Draguignan, who rejected him because he was poor.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The woman whom rejected owned a bar in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal/8-decembre-1934/100/425641/3|title=Le Petit Journal (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
His crimes were committed in a particular area; the journalists grouped them under the name of "The Crimes of Haut-Var".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k578554p|title=Le Matin: last telegrams of the night|last=|first=|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Roumo ===
Joseph Roumo was murdered in front of his shop in [[Flayosc]], in 1930.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k46995074|title=Le Peuple: daily organ of unionism|author=General Confederation of Labor|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in similar circumstances to the other four victims, but Sasia wasn't prosecuted for this crime.

=== Marius Vassal ===
While napping near an oak tree in [[Taradeau]], Vassal, a horticulturist, was shot dead on March 4, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4619921k|title=L'Œuvre|last=|first=|date=November 5, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7640066q|title=Paris-soir|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later found hidden, and the hundred [[franc]]s he was carrying on him were gone.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; At first, the judge indicted a "lunatic" for this killing, who dies shortly after his arrest.

=== Fernand Troin ===
Troin was murdered in Flayosc, on August 5, 1934.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/7-novembre-1935/677/2987907/6|title=Le Petit Provençal (November 7, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The octogenarian was returning home with provisions, when he passed by the place where his soon-to-be-killer was hiding. The latter shot Fernand, stealing his food and the ten francs he was carrying.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; A postwoman, who claimed to have seen the killer, was later unable to recognize Sasia at trial.

=== Félicien Rouvier ===
Félicien Rouvier, 35, was murdered on October 19, 1934, at [[Ampus]].&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Sasia, who was familiar with the place, also knew that the shepherd was gone during the day, and that he had money on him. He placed himself in an alcove, until Félicien returned with his sheep at nightfall. As he entered the house, he was shot with [[Shotgun shell|buckshot]], and collapsed on the ground.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Sasia then stole a watch, handkerchief, and the 137-160 francs, while the victim lay dying.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

He confessed the crime after Rouvier's watch was discovered in his pockets, after he was arrested. He claimed to have killed Félicien, as he needed money to pay some fines.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=== Gianni Galliano ===
The 26-year-old chauffeur Galliano, who was on a work-related trip, was murdered in [[Vérignon]] on November 30, 1934.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7633941n|title=Le Journal|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; While searching through Sasia's home, the gendarmes discovered Galliano's glove, leading to the first confessions. Sasia claimed to have had an altercation with the chauffeur on the road to [[Canjuers]], deciding to shoot and rob him, before hiding the body. He shouted for Gianni to stop the vehicle, before shooting him.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The mobile was the same one as Félicien Rouvier's.

== Arrest ==
Sasia was arrested by two policemen patrolling along the railway linking [[Vidauban]] to [[Les Arcs, Var|Les Arcs]]. He was walking around with his rifle by his side, perhaps looking for a new victim,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/la-tribune-de-l-aube/8-decembre-1934/1217/3194659/2|title=La Tribune (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attitude provoked the interested of the policemen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; His appearance corresponded to the report broadcast eight days earlier. As Sasia could not present a hunting permit, he was taken in by the gendarmerie, to which he instantly admitted to having hunted without a license, as well as confessing to his theft convictions. Giuseppe claimed to reside in the neighborhood of Nouradons aux Arcs.

The gendarmes discovered on him the watch stolen from the corpse of Félicien Rouvier, prompting Sasia to quickly confess his guilt. He explained that he premeditated the action, waiting for the shepherd to arrive before killing him. From the on, the gendarmes searched his home, where they found six watches, five wallets and a pair of gloves, which turned out to be Galliano's. Sasia admitted to that murder as well, claiming at first that they had fought before, before acknowledging that he killed Gianni so he could rob him.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Soon after, he acknowledged the murder of Vassal and Troin, but denied responsibility for the 1930 crime.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When presented before the magistrate on the following day, he partly recanted his confession, recognizing only the two crimes for which there was evidence: those of Rouvier and Galliano. He claimed to have committed the crimes so he could pay his fines and evade prison. The investigators discovered two transfers made on the days after the two murders, and the presence of several watches raised concerns about other possible victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-populaire/9-decembre-1934/110/1470579/2|title=Le Populaire (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia declared after his arrest: "I deserve the guillotine".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; On December 18, he was charged with four murders, premeditated murder, followed by theft, and highway robbery with aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4699518x|title=Le Peuple: daily organ of unionism|author=General Confederation of Labor|date=December 19, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==
He was tried before the [[cour d'assises]] on November 5, 1935.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Sasia acknowledged the murders of Rouvier and Galliano, but plead [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], trying to present it as a failed robbery. He denied being the perpetrator of the other two killings.

Experts analyzed that the four victims were shot in similar circumstances, with buckshot at 4–5 meters in the shootings.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The chief doctor of the asylum, Dr. Pierrefeu, noted that Sasia was fully aware of his actions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She declared: "He is a man who possesses to a high degree the feel of material things, and who has the mentality of a man of the woods; he is far from civilized. His mental level is low and, by poaching, he has assimilated men to the animals he was killing. His emotivity is null and his regret is purely verbal. But Sasia is not crazy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Watchmakers, who had repaired Vassal's watch on previous occasions, recognized it when it was shown to them by the gendarmes.:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

After several minutes of deliberation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/excelsior/7-novembre-1935/353/2773791/1/bb1586c5a31372b6b3c4d2d7fa7323ad|title=Giuseppe Sasia is condemned to death|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; jurors recognized him as guilty of the four murders and condemned him to the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Over five hundred people attended the last day of the trial.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

== Execution ==
His clemency was rejected,&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; despite a meeting between his lawyer and the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75974242|title=The free man: daily newspaper morning / editor, Georges Clemenceau; Director, Fr. Albert|last=|first=|date=February 11, 1936|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia showed no regret before his conviction. During his detention on the [[death row]], he requested the support of an [[almoner]] and began to regret his actions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k47292616|title=Paris-midi: only daily newspaper appearing at noon / dir. Maurice de Waleffe|last=|first=|date=February 17, 1936|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not support the approach chosen for his execution, and had several crises of despair. After the execution of Niccolini in [[Avignon]], the guillotine was brought to Draguignan.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/16-fevrier-1936/677/2988107/5|title=Le Petit Provençal (February 16, 1936)|publisher=Retronews - Press site for the BNF site|accessdate=November 23, 2019|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia was executed on February 17, 1936, at 6:10 on La République Street, in front of the Draguignan Prison.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; While it was deployed in the public square, a large part of the service was set up to prevent from attending the execution.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/18-fevrier-1936/677/2988101/5|title=Le Petit Provençal (February 18, 1936)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his lawyer, his last words were: "It's annoying to die".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; His body was later deposited at the Draguignan cemetery.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Controversy over deportation ==
A controversy arose from the fact that Sasia, an Italian national, was the subject of a deportation order from the gendarmes, since his first conviction. This, however, had not been applied: the prefecture's secretary was accused of favoring extremist immigrants, and thereafter removed from office.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

'''Julio Pérez Silva''' (born July 15, 1963 in [[Puchuncaví]]) is a [[Chile]]an [[serial killer]] active between 1998 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portalnet.cl/comunidad/art-y-relatos-gore.165/952665-biografia-julio-perez-silva.html Biography of Julio Pérez Silva on portalnet.cl]&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the '''Psychopath from Alto Hospicio''', his crimes took place in the [[Tarapacá Region]], specifically in the city of [[Iquique]] and in the town of [[Alto Hospicio]], hence his nickname.&lt;ref name="La Cuarta"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burlé O. |first1=Dominique |title=They ask to reopen case of the Alto Hospicio psychopath {{!}} (Piden reabrir caso del sicópata de Alto Hospicio) |url=http://www.lacuarta.com/noticia/piden-reabrir-caso-del-sicopata-de-alto-hospicio/ |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=www.lacuarta.com |date=4 March 2014 |language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPS News"&gt;{{cite news |title=RIGHTS-CHILE: Police Negligence in Serial Killings of Poor Teens {{!}} Inter Press Service |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2001/10/rights-chile-police-negligence-in-serial-killings-of-poor-teens/ |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=IPS Correspondents |agency=www.ipsnews.net |issue= |publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service |date=13 October 2001 |location=SANTIAGO, Chile |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[modus operandi]] was always the same. Working as a taxi driver, he intercepted young people with offers of free rides, then would take them somewhere remote, where he would rape and kill them with blows to the head. Later, Silva would throw the bodies in deep abandoned mines. He was convicted of killing 14 women and was sentenced to life imprisonment on February 26, 2004.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Locker |first1=Melissa |title=South America's 8 Scariest Serial Killers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/south-americas-8-scariest-serial-killers-112761/julio-perez-silva-chile-113020/ |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
"Segua", as he was called in his childhood, spent most of years among the streets of [[Puchuncaví]]. Those who knew at the school where he studied agreed that he was a quiet, introverted student.

He married at the age of 22 to Monica Cistemas, a native of [[La Calera, Chile|La Calera]], and they had two daughters. Then, he spent five years with Marianela Vergara, who already had two other daughters. With her he returned to Puchuncaví and reaped the reputation of a good husband.

In the mid-1990s he emigrated to Iquique looking for better job opportunities, finding a job loading sacks of salt. At a party he met Nancy Boero, fourteen years older than him and a mother of six children. After two weeks they were living together and then settled in Alto Hospicio, in a sector known as "La Negra". Later they would move to "Autoconstruccíon", another local sector.

Soon, he left his job to start as a taxi driver illegally. It was then that he began a string of crimes, all of similar characteristics.

==Crimes==
On September 17, 1998, he picked up 17-year-old Montserrat Graciela Saravia on the waterfront of Iquique. According to his confession, she offered him money in exchange for sex. However, this young woman's real intention was to steal from him. When he noticed this, he beat her to death and left her on a beach.

On November 24, 1999, while driving in Alto Hospicio, he offered 13-year-old Macarena Sanchez a ride to her school. After threatening her with a knife and raping her, he tied her hands and threw her into the Huantajaya Pique, which is more 220 meters deep.

In February 2000 he attacked twice in less than a week; the first was Sara Gomez on February 21, and just 2 days later 23-year-old cellphone promoter Angelica Lay, both of whom were killed in the middle of the desert.

On March 23 of the same year, exactly one month after the fourth murder, he assaulted and murdered 14-year-old Laura Zola, and like Sanchez, she was raped and murdered in Huantajaya.

Then, on April 5, he attacked Katherine Arce, whom he raped and murdered like Angelica Lay, then buried her body in an unofficial garbage dump.

On May 22, 17-year-old Patricia Palma left the lyceum on her way home. It was at that moment that Silva kidnapped, raped and killed her, leaving her body in Huantajaya along with the corpses of Sanchez and Zola.

Eleven days later, on June 2, he attacked again. He raped and murdered Macarena Montecinos in the "Pampa El Molle" sector, who suffered the same fate as Lay and Arce. The same fate befell 15-year-old Viviana Garay, who was intercepted, raped and killed with a blow to the head. The luck would be different this time, since the father of the last minor mobilized the relatives of other victims, who according to the authorities and the police had fled from their homes, immersed in poverty, to [[Peru]] or [[Bolivia]], looking for a better future.

Because of this, Perez did not attack for nine months, but on April 17, 2001, he struck again in the sector "Autoconstrccíon" where he intercepted a child under 16 years identified as Maritza, threatening her with a knife and raping her, but did not kill her. Later she managed to escape and returned home. They took her to the hospital, where they took samples of the aggressor's [[semen]]. Although Maritza wasn't able to see her attacker due to the darkness, months later, when they checked him, she recognized his voice. They compared the DNA samples and they were identical.

==Reactions of the press and victims' relatives==
During all that time, the mysterious disappearances of so many young women from Alto Hospicio reached national coverage. However, the authorities of the time - mainly under the Secretary of Interior at the time, [[Jorge Burgos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|title=Burgos describes "legitimate" manifestations of relatives of victims of the Psychopath of Alto Hospicio against their appointment|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/02/674-567277-9-burgos-califica-como-legitimas-manifestaciones-de-familiares-de-victimas-de.shtml|publisher=La Tercera|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=25 June 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and the police assumed that it was most likely that the young people fled their homes due to poverty, possibly migrating to [[Tacna]] or Bolivia. There were even some suggestions that the girls probably engaged in prostitution. This fact diverted even more attention from the true motive of the disappearances.

However, with the disappearance of Viviana Garay generated a totally unexpected reaction. The father of the girl, Orlando Garay, mobilized the other affected families. Only then did the event become news, so the crimes briefly stopped.

The Mea Culpa program made a special about this case in 2003.

==Discovery of the murderer==
===Searching for the truth===
Orlando Garay, father of one of the victims Viviana Garay, began to fight for the truth and did not accept the authorities' speculations, selling his fisherman's boat to gather the families of other disappeared girls to find answers. On July 18, 2000, a bag and clothes belonging to Viviana were found on a rubbish dump where, according to her family and friends, she never went to; That same day, in another landfill, the neighbours found Katherine Acre's backpack and uniform. On July 20, Inés Valdivia, mother of Patricia Palma, distinguished her daughter's underwear in a ravine. This was how family members, friends and neighbours looked for the young women.

===Last crime and arrest===
On October 4, 2001, Perez made this last attack, when a young woman identified as Bárbara Nuñez survived. He intercepted and attacked in the same way he did with other victims, the difference was that Silva confessed to being the murderer; After he had hit her with a stone on the head and thinking she was dead, he left. Bárbara survived however, and managed to report the attack. That same day he was arrested; without any remorse he admitted to the murders and rapes, also confessing to having acted alone and denying having [[dementia]]. After his arrest, Perez provided the necessary information to locate the other victims' bodies. Currently, he is monitored 24 hours a day and is subjected to sleep control, after he once tried to commit suicide in his cell with a shoelace wound to a toothbrush.

So far, the names of five other disappeared young and adult women emerged in Alto Hospicio area between April 1999 and August 2001. However, Silva claims to know nothing about them.

===Condemnation===
Finally, on February 26, 2004, Perez, 40 years old at the time, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole  for the murders of 11 adolescents and 3 adults in the attempted murder of other 2. He is currently incarcerated in the high security prison of Colina I in [[Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/judicial/alto-hospicio/sicopata-de-alto-hospicio-fue-condenado-a-cadena-perpetua-simple/2004-02-26/135929.html "Psychopath of Alto Hospicio" was sentenced to simple life imprisonment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
According to the investigations, the 14 victims of Julio Pérez Silva, murdered between September 12, 1998 and August 23, 2001, would be:
* Viviana Garay, 16
* Katherine Arce, 16

'''Ludwig Slavov Tolumov''' (born 1950) and '''Ivan Serafimov Ivanov''' (born 1956 - July 15, 2000), also known jointly as '''The Sour and The Sweet''', were a pair of [[Bulgaria]]n robbers, rapists and [[serial killer]]s who, in the span of two months in 2000, murdered 3 people and robbed several others. Serafimov, who was solely responsible for a murder in 1996, was shot by his partner Tolumov, who himself was subsequently apprehended and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=sketch&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/3236511|title=Cruel killer captured due to portrait, sketched by policeman|author=Anelia Percheva|publisher=24 Chasa|date=12 February 2014|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evil&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.crimes.bg/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/8310-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%86%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BE.html|title=Bulgaria's Serial Killers. The Deadly Duo|publisher=crimes.bg|date=18 January 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographies==
===Early lives===
Both Tolumov and Serafimov were born in the little village of Duvanli, where they were childhood friends, but eventually separated after the former moved to [[Hisar, Bulgaria|Hisar]] so he could live with new wife, Penka, who later gave birth to three children. Not long after, Ludwig went on to temporarily live in [[Germany]], before moving to [[Namibia]]. In the meantime, Serafimov became a habitual criminal, spending a total of 15 years behind bars after 8 consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery. While imprisoned, he earned the nickname "The Sweet" because of his ability to sweet talk and his love for sweets.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

After many years, while Serafimov was serving his 8th sentence for robbery in the Plovdiv Prison, he reunited with Tolumov, who was imprisoned for theft. During this prison stint, they decided to form their deadly criminal duet. After Serafimov's release in March 2000, he returned to a life of crime, now aided by his partner.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;
===First murder===
On May 13, 2000, a couple, consisting of 19-year-old Ruzhdiye Useinova from Pravoslaven and 20-year-old Sevgin Myumyun from Voden, had decided to go to a disco in the "Mogilata" complex near the village of [[Varbitsa, Haskovo Province]]. They had stopped at a gas station near [[Byala Reka, Plovdiv Province|Byala Reka]] to gas up their car, before continuing on their journey, only to stop again to the side of the road 20 minutes after midnight, so they could talk and kiss each other. Suddenly, from the darkness the silhouettes of two men appeared, who immediately attacked the couple without saying a word. The criminals broke the car's window and with slaps and kicks pulled out Sevgin and Ruzhdiye from the vehicle. They tried to attack the girl, whose boyfriend tried to defend her. However, Sevgin was beaten harshly, before being shot in the eyesocket and the spine. They lied to the girl that they had only knocked him out, and he'd be awake after 3-4 hours. The men then robbed the corpse of his gold earrings and rings, his telephone and cassette player, and then dragged it to some bushes by the road. Tolumov and Serafimov then forced the shocked Ruzhdiye into the car, driving her to a small chapel called "St. Elijah", where they brutally beat and subsequently raped her, one after the other.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

After the brutal deed, they proceeded to stab her 8 times in the neck, breasts and stomach before fleeing the scene, thinking they had eliminated their only witness, relying on the fact that the authorities might think that the murders were a result from a love-related drama between the two. However, Useinova had miraculously survived, the blade from the knife just barely missing her [[external carotid artery]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; After being unconscious for some time, the tortured woman eventually woke up, and managed to crawl her way to the road after some hours, where she was accidentally found by a [[Parvomay]] policeman. Barely managing to utter that she was attacked, she again lapsed into unconsciousness, whereupon the officer immediately brought her to the hospital. During the subsequent search of the area, Myumyun's body was located.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

While she was recovering from her injuries in hospital, Useinova was visited by the now-retired police sketch artist Atanas Marincheshki, to whom she described the offenders.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt; The man managed to produce an incredibly accurate [[facial composite]] of Tolumov, as couldn't do the same for Serafimov, who had tried to hide his face from the victim.

Shortly following the attack, the authorities managed to shorten the suspect circle to 20 names in the criminal registry, with detectives from the National Police's "Murders" Unit aiding the Plovdiv authorities, working 24 hours a day so they could resolve the crime.

===Robberies and thefts===
In the meantime, Tolumov and Serafimov continued with the criminal deeds. On June 6, the duo attacked a parked minibus in the "[[Troyan]]-Karnare" Pass, stealing combine parts and personal items worth 8265 [[Bulgarian lev|leva]]. They threatened the driver, Tanyo Bahchevanski, and proceeded to steal the minibus itself, only to later abandon it.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

Five days later, they beat up and robbed a female taxi driver near the village of Belovitsa, and not long after, robbed a man from [[Sofia]] along the [[Trakia motorway]].&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; Three weeks after that, near the village of Mihiltsi, they robbed a man and a woman in a parked [[Moskvitch]]. The men fired at the car and forced to driver to lay down on the ground, but he managed to flee and call for help at a nearby gas station. Tolumov abandoned his partner, while Serafimov got into the car and forced the woman to have sex with him.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

===Double murder===
On July 12, a body was found by accident near the architectural-historical memorial "Arch of Freedoms" in [[Beklemeto Pass]]. It was later revealed that on that day Tolumov and Serafimov had stopped the car of German tourists Christian Herlem and Heidi Colomb, both from [[Kassel]] - near [[Pavel Banya]]. There, they killed Herlem and later dropped off his body into the abyss, before taking Colomb to Mount Bratan, where she was reportedly raped. After raping her, both men threw the woman into the nearby swamp, effectively drowning her. Her skull was later located, with parts of her body scattered around the place, most likely by wild animals.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

The police quickly contacted German authorities, sending the victims' items to them. In order to capture the bandits, agents from [[Interpol]] took action, drawing accurate facial composites of the criminals in accordance to the surviving victims.

==Serafimov's death and Tolumov's capture==
While the investigators were working on capturing the criminals, distrust began to settle between Tolumov and Serafimov. On July 15, while driving towards [[Hisarya, Bulgaria|Hisarya]], the two began arguing. Tolumov, suspecting that his childhood friend was planning to kill him, offered to stop the car. Immediately after this, he pulled out his gun and shot Serafimov, killing him on the spot.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; He then put his body in the trunk of the car and dropped it off at a ditch near Tsarimir. To erase his traces, he later burned the car.

Between July 19 and 20, a man and a woman working for TV company Evrokom, while trying to shoot footage for a film, accidentally found the body of a man who was dressed in a sailor's shirt and looked to be around his 40s. He had gunshot wounds to his back and chest area. Later fingerprint examinations proved that it was indeed Ivan "The Sweet" Serafimov.

The police then proceeded to question his friends, calling in a total of 9 people, among them two women and a [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] man. The deceased eerily matched the description of one of the perpetrators who had attacked Ruzhdiye Useinova, while his buddy Ludwig Tolumov looked like the other man. After a brief investigation, it was concluded that they had done a number of violent crimes, and that Tolumov had killed his partner. He was arrested in Hisarya soon after, without offering any resistance. Ludwig confessed to the rape of Useinova and the thefts, but denied the murders, only admitting to that of Serafimov, claiming to have done it to protect the lives of his family and other people.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

==Evidence==
The authorities had strong evidence, including DNA samples, to convict Tolumov. It was determined that a pistol with a silencer was used in the murders of Herlem and Serafimov, while in the murder of Myumyun - an [[MP 40]]. In accordance to the different situations, the criminals would use either of the two weapons. The MP 40 was later found on August 10 in Tolumov's home.

Although apparent that Serafimov was the main act in the murders, Tolumov acted as his accomplice without hesitation. Not only this, but the former is also thought to be responsible for the 1996 murder of a woman named Elena Filipova, in her home near the Plovdiv Boulevard "Maritsa".&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

According to the psychoanalysis of Ludwig Tolumov, he is [[egocentrism|egocentric]], selfish and demands control of others, feeling good when he controls the course of action and dominates over everybody else. He is devoid of any regret and likes to show off, but also stands out with a high degree of self-control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Trial and sentence==
During Tolumov's trial, he stated that the murder charges should be dropped, as he had acted in self-defence. After hearing this, Embie Myumyun, Sevgin's mother, began cussing at him. Sitting next to her was the still shocked Ruzhdiye. On July 3, 2003, Tolumov was sentenced to the harshest sentence available for aggravated murder - life imprisonment. He would have to serve it in the Plovdiv Central Prison under a special regime. In his last words to the court, he said the following:&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

{{cquote|quote="I'm sorry for some of the deeds, but I'm not responsible for the robbery and murder of Sevgin. I admit to participating in the rape of the girl, but I was forced to do so by Ivan, if it wasn't for me, the girl wouldn't be alive."}}

The magistrates also gave a guilty verdict over robbing tourists at Beklemeto Pass in June 2000, as well giving an additional 15 years imprisonment for murdering Ivan Serafimov.

==Aftermath==
On August 11, 2011, Ludwig's 22-year-old son, Slavi, was found hanging in the family home in Duvanli. Slavi had lived with his mother's family in Hisar's Catholic district, where his grandfather Milan was looking after him, as his mother was working abroad in [[Italy]]. His death was ruled a suicide, most likely due to the fact he couldn't suffer living with the knowledge that his father was a brutal killer. Just a month before, he had moved back to Duvanli and the empty house, which was abandoned after the grandparents had died years before. The villagers noted that he seemed depressed, didn't speak to anyone and refused to go to the café with friends. The boy had worked in Italy as a builder on request by his mother, but he had decided to return to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.karlovo-online.com/hisar/item/1593-%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86-%D1%81%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B8|title=Son of a serial killer hanged himself|publisher=Karlovo Online|date=18 August 2011|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Penka, had also lost her other son 2 years before. She currently lives isolated in a monastery.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt; In response to this, Tolumov commented that this ruined his parents, who died during the trial, and that he still keeps the necrologues of his sons. He also said that he keeps regular contact with the priest in Novi Khan, sending him money for his children over [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.lifebites.bg/killer-bestseller/|title=Killer writes best-seller in prison|author=Borislav Radoslavov and Borislav Troshev|publisher=lifebites.bg|date=24 August 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Tolumov and another murderer, Dimitar Harakchiev, were awarded compensation of 3000 and 4000 leva following a trial in the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], due to the bad hygiene, ventilation and other problems which went on in the prison's cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://dnes.dir.bg/politika/kilii-toaletni-evropeyski-sad-pravata-%D1%87oveka-loshi-uslovia-17029400|title=Murderers sentenced Bulgaria for cells without toilets|publisher=Dnes.dir.bg|date=12 July 2014|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned, Tolumov began writing an autobiography, detailing all the events of his life leading up to his arrest. He said the book would be called "Chronicles of a Life Sentence". His prison cell is considered lavish, as he has a flat screen TV, coffee machine, radio, a metal fan, renewed window panels and an old typing machine, on which he is currently writing the book.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/4936406|title=Ludwig Tolumov: I shot my friend with 4 bullets|author=Borislav Radoslavov|publisher=[[24 Chasa]]|date=21 August 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdullah Shah''' (1965–2004) was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[serial killer]] found guilty in [[Kabul]] of killing more than 20 people, including his wife.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Former Afghan commander executed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3662935.stm  |date=27 April 2004 |work=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]] |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sanctioned execution was the first in [[Afghanistan]] since the fall of the [[Taliban]] in late 2001.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Shah served under [[Zardad Khan]]—even earning the nickname '''Zardad's dog'''— who served under [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] in the [[civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Shah and Zardad robbed travelers on the road from Kabul to [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]].

Shah was first convicted in special court proceedings in October 2002. Nine people testified against him at the trial, including another wife he tried to set on fire. The bodies of many of Shah's victims were found in a well in [[Paghman District]].

The execution took place in the [[Pul-e-Charkhi jail]]. Interim president [[Hamid Karzai]] signed the death warrant.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; At the execution, Shah was shot in the back of the head. Witnesses present included representatives of the Afghan police, the Attorney General's office and doctors.

[[Amnesty International]] protested against the execution claiming Afghanistan avoided basic standards of fairness. The organization added that Shah was probably silenced so he could not testify against commanders allied to the government.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It said he was not provided a defense attorney, the trial was secret, a confession was obtained under torture and the first judge in his case was dismissed for taking a bribe. The second judge came under pressure from the Supreme Court to impose the sentence.

'''Cayetano Santos Godino''' (October 31, 1896 – November 15, 1944), also known as '''"El Petiso Orejudo"''' ("The Big-Eared Midget"), was an Argentinian [[serial killer]] who terrorized [[Buenos Aires]] at the age of 16. In the early 20th century, he was responsible for the [[murder]] of four children, the [[attempted murder]] of another seven children, and seven counts of [[arson]].

==Early life==
Godino was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, one of eight boys. His father and mother, Fiore Godino and Lucia Ruffo, were alcoholics and abusive. Godino's father contracted [[syphilis]] before Godino was born, causing Godino to experience serious childhood health problems.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casoabierto.com/reportajes/cronica-negra/cayetano-santos-godino-la-historia-del-petiso-orejudo.html |title=Cayetano Santos Godino, la historia del Petiso Orejudo |last=Cabezas López |first=Carlos |date=2007-09-16 |work=Caso Abierto |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801214210/http://www.casoabierto.com/reportajes/cronica-negra/cayetano-santos-godino-la-historia-del-petiso-orejudo.html |archivedate=2008-08-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Early signs of social mismanagement ==
Starting in childhood, Godino killed cats and birds, and enjoyed playing with fire. His violent behavior and lack of interest in education caused him to move from school to school.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

When he was seven years old, Godino beat two-year-old Miguel de Paoli and threw him into a ditch. A nearby official saw this and led the children to the police station, where their mothers picked them up a few hours later.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

A year later, Godino beat Ana Neri, a child in his neighborhood, with a stone. A police officer intervened, but Godino was released from jail due to his young age.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

When he was 10, Godino's parents discovered his compulsive [[masturbation]]. Not knowing what to do with him, his mother told the police, resulting in a two-month jail term for him&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; as masturbation was illegal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Penal Code of the United States of Brazil |type=Decree |number=847 |language=Portuguese |date=11 October 1890 |article=282 |articletype=Article |url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/decret/1824-1899/decreto-847-11-outubro-1890-503086-publicacaooriginal-1-pe.html |accessdate=24 November 2017}} Printed in [http://bd.camara.gov.br/bd/bitstream/handle/bdcamara/19080/colleccao_leis_1890_parte2.pdf.pdf ''Coleção de Leis dea République do Brasil: Premeiro Fasciculo''] 10:2664, 2710 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime spree ==
On January 17, 1912, Godino set fire to a warehouse on Corrientes Street. When he was arrested, he told police, "I like to see firemen working. It's nice to see how they fall into the fire."&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; On January 26, 1912, Arturo Laurona, 13, was found dead in an abandoned house. A few months later, on March 7, 1912, Godino set fire to the dress of Reyna Vainicoff, 5, who did not recover and died some days later.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In late September 1912, he set fire to a railway station, though the fire was extinguished without extensive damage. On November 8, 1912, he tried to choke 8-year-old Roberto Russo. He was [[arrest]]ed and charged with attempted murder, but was released until the trial. On November 16, 1912, he assaulted a three-year-old, Carmen Ghittoni, who suffered minor wounds before a police officer intervened and Godino ran off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://foro.cuandocalientaelsol.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;p=272817 |title=Cayetano Santos Godino, el precoz "Petiso Orejudo" |date=2010-11-02 |website=Foro Cuando calienta el sol |language=es |access-date=2016-02-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223094018/http://foro.cuandocalientaelsol.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;p=272817 |archive-date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 1912, he [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] two-year-old Carolina Neolener, who cried out and was rescued by a neighbour. Later in the same month, he set fire to two large sheds, but the fires were quickly extinguished.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On December 3, 1912, Godino saw 18-month-old Jesualdo Giordano playing outside his house and offered to buy the boy some sweets to convince him to go with him. Providing a few sweets then offering more, Godino took Giordano to a country house. When they were inside, he threw him to the floor and unsuccessfully tried to choke him with his belt. Then he cut his belt and tied his hands and legs. He started beating him and considered hammering his head. He left the house looking for a nail and saw Giordano's father, to whom he said he did not know where the child was. He then re-entered the house with the nail. He hammered it into the side of Giordano's skull and hid the corpse.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The body was found by the father minutes later. At 8:00 PM, Godino went to the wake and touched the skull where he had fixed the nail. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 4, 1912, he was arrested by police, confessing his crimes.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Jail==
On January 4, 1913, he entered a [[reformatory]], where he tried to kill some of the inmates. Because medical reports declared him insane, the judge discontinued the case and ordered him to stay in the reformatory. On November 12, 1915, an appeal was approved ordering him to be moved to jail on November 20.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On March 28, 1923, Godino was transferred to [[Ushuaia]] Penitentiary. Throughout 1933 he spent some time in the hospital for a beating he suffered from inmates after he killed two of their pet cats. From 1935 onwards, he was always ill and received no visitors until he died on November 15, 1944 under suspicious circumstances.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Harald Sassak'''&amp;nbsp;(born 1948; died August 21, 2013&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;[[Weitra]]&lt;ref name=work&gt;[http://www.noen.at/lokales/noe-uebersicht/gmuend/aktuell/Gaskassier-Sassak-starb-in-Weitra;art2511,480360 „Gaskassier“ Sassak starb in Weitra].&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Austria]]n&amp;nbsp;[[serial killer]] who went into criminal history as a gas assassin. He was also the longest-serving of Austrian imprisoned convicts. In the years 1971 and 1972 he committed, inter alia, six killings out of greed and served a [[life sentence]] in prison for them.

== Life ==
Harald Sassak was the son of a bricklayer and an operator. He learned as a plumber and did his military service in the army from 1966 to 1969 in the [[Lainz]] hospital as an auxiliary. After he suffered from [[jaundice]], he did not bring his employer medical confirmation and was therefore dismissed. He also gave up his subsequent job as a confectioner. He was described as very friendly and helpful by his family, friends and superiors. He always very well in school and did not receive any disciplinary sanctions from the army.

When one day an elderly woman approached him, asking him if he could repair her gas appliance and then tipped him, he developed an idea he called the "gas trick."

Between August 31, 1970 and February 12, 1972, he spent time with elderly people as a servant of the [[gasworks]], who wanted to check their equipment. As soon as he knew where the covert funds were, he diverted his victim, for example, by asking for a glass of water. If caught in the act, he killed his victim and fled. In some raids his accomplice Johann Sharaditsch, whom he had met in a liquor room, helped him.

Surviving victims said that a chubby, nice man had asked for admission with the words: "The gas man is here!". He was always well dressed, and had a seemingly valid identity card and expertise. Only after the victims revealed their money caches did he strike them down and rob them. Except for a single fingerprint, which could not be assigned to any person from the police files, no trace of the offender was left. However, when a neighbour of one of the victims, a graphic designer, had a very accurate facial composite of the perpetrator made by the draftsman of the bureau, the search became more concrete. A waiter of the Reiser hotel recognized the man as Harald Sassak by the facial composite and led the officials to the culprit, who was drinking a glass of wine. One of his victims identified him at the hotel and Sassak was arrested. On the way to the office he confessed to his crimes.

On January 22, 1974, Sassak's trial began, with the reading of the indictment taking more than an hour. He confessed to his crimes, but claimed he did not participate in any murders. The coroner said that 79-year old Richard Langer and 86-year old Josefa Fierlinger died as a direct result of the violence. 69-year old Aloisia Meschnark died of kidney failure 17 days after being hospitalized, 66-year old Rosa Schwarz after seven days of brain soreness, 86-year old Maria Aberle and 85-year old Eleonore Hauer after ten or 38 days of pneumonia. According to the report, there was a connection between the death of women and the use of force. Gabriele Hammer, who died 54 days after being attacked by Sassak, could no longer find evidence of violence.

On February 7, 1974, Sassak was convicted of robbing Josefa Fierlinger, the predatory manslaughter of Richard Langer, Aloisia Meschnark, Rosa Schwarz, Maria Aberle and Eleonore Hauer, as well as robbery and theft in nine cases, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. His accomplice, Johann Sharaditsch, was guilty of theft, robbery in two cases and theft in two cases and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.&lt;ref name=work /&gt;

Sassak died on August 21, 2013, as a result of prolonged illness in a [[Lower Austria]]n nursing home, after being released from prison shortly after more than being 39 years behind bars.

'''Hugo Schenk''' (born February 11, 1849, in [[Čechy pod Kosířem]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://actapublica.eu/matriky/brno/prohlizec/5576/?strana=57 |title=Geburtsbuch |trans-title=Register of births |date=1849 |website=Moravský zemský archiv Brno [Moravian Regional Archive Brno] |language=de |access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; died April 22, 1884 in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[serial killer]] and imposter who murdered four maids with the help of his accomplice, Karl Schlossarek (1858 - 1884).

== Activities ==
Hugo Schenk was born into a well-off family as a son of a judge working in [[Cieszyn]]. His brother worked as a community doctor in [[Maria Taferl]]. In 1869 and 1870 he began his criminal life as an escapee from the henchmen of the [[Tsar]] from [[Warsaw]], Prince Boleslav von Wilopolsky, and was tried as a marriage swindler to get the dowry of the alleged brides. Sentenced on December 5, 1870, to a five-year stay at the [[Mírov]] detention center for a number of serious frauds, but was pardoned and released after two years.

At the age of 32, he was once again convicted of marital fraud for two years in a heavy dungeon at the Stein Prison. In prison he met Karl Schlossarek, who was imprisoned for theft. After his release in January 1883 Schenk met the 34-year old Josefine Timal, who worked as a maid in Vienna, where he worked as a railway engineer and promised her marriage. Timal gave into his confidence, quit her job, packed all her valuables and drove with him to the alleged honeymoon to [[Kraków]]. However, he raped her near the [[Hranice Abyss]]. With the help of Schlossarek, he gagged and tied Timal, robbed her of valuables and sank her with a heavy stone into the abyss.

Because Schenk was of the opinion that her aunt Katharina, who worked as a maid in [[České Budějovice|Budweis]], could notice her niece's disappearance, he also planned to kill her. He wrote to her that he had married Josefine and invited her to his estate. On June 21, 1883, he picked her up from the station and drove her to [[Krummnußbaum]], where he overpowered and killed her along the banks of the [[Danube]], along with Schlossarek. After taking all her valuables, they sank Katharina into the Danube. Only six weeks later Schenk murdered the maid Theresia Ketterl in a gorge in [[Lilienfeld]] to get her valuables. On December 28, 1883, the duo murdered and buried maid Rosa Ferenszi in the Danube at [[Kittsee]] to rob her.

== Execution ==
On January 10, 1884, Hugo Schenk was arrested, and just a day later - Karl Schlossarek. Both were [[sentenced to death]] by hanging and executed on April 22, 1884, in Court No. 1 of the Vienna Regional Court.

== Legacy ==
The skull of Hugo Schenk, which was autopsied and neurologically examined after the execution by Viennese neurologist [[Moritz Benedikt]], is in the Vienna Criminal Museum. The writer [[Egon Kisch]] (1885 - 1948) has dealt with the story of a woman who survived Schenk's attack.

'''Michaiah Shobek''' (born 1954 as '''James Michael Shoffner''' - October 19, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who murdered three fellow American tourists in the Bahamas from December 1973 to January 1974.&lt;ref name=put&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/07/archives/americans-hanging-in-bahamas-put-off.html|title=American's Hanging in Bahamas Put Off|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=7 October 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/19/archives/bahamas-to-execute-an-american-today-for-murder-of-3-tourists.html|title=Bahamas to Execute an American Today for Murder of 3 Tourists|publisher=Associated Press|date=19 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently executed for his crimes.

==Biography==
Born James Michael Shoffner in Milwaukee, Shobek grew up with his mother Juanita Spencer, a cleaner at a Milwaukee school, without knowing his father. He caught a [[viral disease]] when he was two years old, suffering permanent brain damage from it.&lt;ref name=put/&gt; As an adult, he began working as a handyman, dreaming of one day becoming a songwriter.&lt;ref name=hang&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://cmuhistory.cmich.edu/cgi-bin/cmuhistory?a=d&amp;d=IsabellaCML19761020.1.2|title=American hanged|publisher=[[Central Michigan Life]]|date=20 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1973, the then 17-year-old moved to the Bahamas to "bum around", changing his name to Michaiah Shobek.&lt;ref name=lucifer&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://bahamianology.com/bahamas-serial-killers-part-2-the-angels-of-lucifer-killer-1974/|title=Bahamas Serial Killers (part 2): The "Angels of Lucifer" Killer 1974|publisher=Bahamianology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murders===
On December 5, 1973, he murdered his first victim, 50-year-old Paul V. Howell, an attorney from [[Massillon, Ohio]] who was attending a convention. On Wednesday evening, Howell was in his hotel room, when he heard a surprising knock on his door. Immediately upon opening it, he was stabbed in the chest and throat, killed instantly. Police suspected that he may have surprised burglars, and focused on that theory, while Howell's body was sent off for preparation of funeral services in native Ohio.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

On January 18 the following year, Shobek murdered his second victim - 44-year-old Irvin Bernstein from [[Ocean City, New Jersey]], an accountant working for the Ministry of Fisheries. The man had arrived in Nassau from [[Miami]] through an Air Bahamas flight the previous day, with Shobek spotting him and offering a ride. He drove Bernstein from the airport, faking sexual advances to distract the man from noticing that they weren't going to the hotel.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

When he stopped the car and pulled out his knife, Bernstein opened the door and tried to escape, but was caught and stabbed to death by his assailant. His body was discovered on Yamacraw Beach the next day, only with socks and shoes on, with multiple stab wounds. A pen and pair of sunglasses belonging to Shobek were found next to the body, while a black bag found in [[Paradise Island]] 8 miles away from there contained some of Bernstein's papers and his killer's driver's license. When he was arrested later on, Shobek was found to be in possession of Bernstein's pen.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

On January 26, he murdered his final victim - 17-year-old student Katie Smith from [[Detroit]], who was on a visit to the Bahamas with a group of other [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] students. The day before her murder, she had been seen walking with Shobek, and the following day, her body was found in a ditch by a cardboard box, apparently strangled to death.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

===Arrest, trial and execution===
Shobek was eventually arrested for murdering Bernstein, but his trial was delayed, as there was a bank robbery investigation going on at the time.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt; When it was resumed in 1975, he confessed to the other murders, claiming that they were "angels of Lucifer", and that he had murdered them by order from God. Although initially sentenced to be hanged on October 8 solely for Bernstein's murder, he was granted an indefinite stay following an appeal filed by the United States Embassy, in which it was claimed that substantial information hadn't been supplied to the court.&lt;ref name=put/&gt;&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

During a psychiatric examination, the authorities learned that Shobek had travelled between the USA and the Bahamas for about two years. Whether he murdered other people during this period is unknown.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

Shobek's execution date was moved to October 19, when he was to be executed at the Fox Hill Prison.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; The day before the hanging, a lawyer from the [[Legal Aid Society]] representing Shobek's mother had pled to then-president [[Gerald Ford]] to make a last-minute appeal, but the request was refused by a presidential aide. And thus, Michaiah Shobek was hanged, his death later being confirmed by the Investigation Department Chief Addington Darville. At that point, he was the first American to be hanged in the Bahamas in 15 years.&lt;ref name=hang/&gt;

'''Ershad Sikder''' (died 10 May 2004) was a Bangladeshi criminal and [[serial killer]], known for committing various crimes such as murder, torture, theft, robbery and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights-china.org/zt/international/200402004115162018.htm{{অকার্যকর সংযোগ|তারিখ=জানুয়ারি ২০১৯ |bot=InternetArchiveBot |ঠিক করার প্রচেষ্টা=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/67211|title=Letter from America: Thoughts on Bangladesh – 6|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to death for murder, and subsequently executed on May 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="dstar"&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/04/21/d40421011818.htm Ershad Shikdar to be hanged on May 10], ডেইলী স্টার, বাংলাদেশ, এপ্রিল ২১, ২০০৪।&lt;/ref&gt;

A song by Abdus Sattar Mohantan, titled "I will be dead", has been popularized throughout the country as Sikder's song.&lt;ref name="song"&gt;[http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jun/20/time.html Orchestra presents Sritimoy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005943/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jun/20/time.html |date=2007-09-28 }}, নিউ এইজ, বাংলাদেশ, জুন ২০, ২০০৫।&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Sikder was born in the Madargona village of Nalchity Upazila, Jhalokati District. His father was Bande Ali. Between 1966–1967, Sikder moved from his birthplace to the Khulna District.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bd-pratidin.com/2013/12/15/32247&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Khulna, Ershad worked as a railway worker for some time. From there, he began gradually robbing along the railway lines and joined a gang. Later, he formed his own gang and earned the name ''Ranga Chora'' from the locals.

Between 1976 and 1977, he formed another gang named ''Ramada Bahini'', which was involved in theft, robberies and terrorist activities along the Khulna Railway Station and the Ghat area. Together with his gang, Ershad occupied the 4th and 5th areas of Ghat, making it his exclusive regulator.

=== Entry into politics ===
In 1982, after the fall of former president [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], Sikder entered politics through the [[Bangladesh Jatiya Party|Jatiya Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3702003.stm|title=BBC NEWS - South Asia - Bangladesh serial killer hanged|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1988 election during the military rule, Sikder was elected as the Commissioner of Ward 8. After forming the BNP government in 1991, Sikder joined it. On December 26, 1996, he again changed his party to the [[Awami League]], but soon after being criticized, he was expelled. At the time of his 1999 arrest, he was still the Commissioner of Ward 8.

=== Criminal acts and murders ===
After entering politics, Sikder's power grew. From 1984 to 1986, he was involved in the possession of Khulna properties, occupying private property, the drug trade, extortion and other criminal activities. In 1991, he drove out the owner of an ice factory named Rafiq, from the 4th Ghat area, appropriated the ice factory and forced all traders to buy ice from him.

It is also known that he used the ice factory as his torture center. Ershad was accused of more than 60 murders, together with one of his collaborators, Rajasakshi Nure Alam. The latter later gave a statement in the court describing 24 killings, further claiming that Sikder has more than 70 victims, although only one weapon was recovered from his house, known as the "Swarnakamal".

=== Personal life ===
It is known that Sikder was married six times. His first wife was Khodeja Begum, whom he married in 1973. Another wife, named Sanjida Akter Shobha, received a luxurious gold house. Aside from them, there were a Taslima of Rupsha Rajapur village, a Farida of Bagerhat, [[Rampal Upazila]]; another unknown wife and a Durgargaire of Pyakgacha. Nure Alam also alleged that his wife Hira was tortured by Ershad.

Ershad's first wife Khodeja gave birth to four children: three sons and a daughter. After his arrest, a fifth child was born, a girl named Jannatul Noorin Emily Essa.

== Arrest and death ==
Sikder was arrested in 1999, with 43 cases filed under his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clcbd.org/201104054517/state-vs-ershad-ali-sikder-and-others-2004-4517.html|title=Chancery Law Chronicles - Login|last=S.M. Saidur Rahman|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a trial at the lower court, he was [[sentenced to death]] in seven murder cases, along with additional four [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]]. He tried to appeal the decision by writing a petition to President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]], but he rejected the appeal, and Sikder was executed at the Khulna Central jail on May 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="dstar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Bangladesh-killer-hanged-20040511|title=Bangladesh killer hanged|website=News24|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Vasilyevich Sergeychik''' ({{Lang-be|Аляксандар Васільевіч Сяргейчык}}, b. 1970, d. November 26, 2007) was a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] [[serial killer]]. He committed murders between 2000 and 2006 in [[Shchuchyn District]] and [[Grodno District]]. He confessed to killing a total of twelve people, however, the investigation could only bring forward enough evidence to convict him of six murders. He was sentenced to death by the court.&lt;ref&gt;Чаровская К. [https://www.sb.by/articles/rasplata-vysshey-meroy.html Расплата высшей мерой] // [[:ru:Советская Белоруссия|Советская Белоруссия]], 23.05.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Sergeychik was born in 1970 in He was born in Semyonovka village, [[Byerastavitsa District]], [[BSSR]] in a large family. He had a brother and a sister. Sergeychik's father was an alcoholic who often beat his wife and children, and then completely abandoned the family for another woman. Sergeychik graduated from the Makarovskaya secondary school. Later, he attended [[vocational school]] to be a driver. From 1989 to 1991, he served in the [[Armed Forces of the USSR]] before he was demobilized in November 1991. After the demobilization, he returned to his native village, where he worked as a driver for a local enterprise.

In March 1992, he saw an announcement about recruitment for the police, where he applied for a position. Sergeychik graduated with honors from the [[Ministry of the Interior Academy of the Republic of Belarus]], married, and had two children. He worked as a company commander of the Grodno District Department. In the workplace, he was described as a "responsible and executive worker". At the time of his arrest, he had the rank of senior police lieutenant.

== Crimes ==
Sergeychik committed his first crime on September 18, 1992, having stolen a trailer on the collective farm "Oktyabr", after which he began to break into garages, stealing cars and other property. He stole a carbine, a [[Walther PP]] pistol and several dummy grenades. In 14 years Sergeychik stole property worth 900 thousand dollars.

He committed his first murder in April 2000, when he picked up 21-year old Helen Boltak as a traveling companion, driving her 76 km in the [[Shchuchyn District]] forest, where he drank a bottle of alcohol prepared beforehand. They engaged in sexual intercourse, and when she lost consciousness, he strangled her, doused her with gasoline and lit her on fire after taking her jewelry and cash.

In June 2000, Sergeychik came to the apartment of his 31-year old mistress, Svetlana Pyrskaya. According to his confession, after a quarrel with her about divorcing his wife,  "in a fit of anger" and "under the influence of alcohol", he strangled her with a TV cable, then staged her suicide by hanging her in the bathroom, after which he took all the cash from the apartment that he could find.

In late July 2000 after acquainting himself with 19-year old Lyudmila Kodik, he took her out on the pretext of checking out the [[Neman]] river, where he drank alcohol with the victim, engaged in sex with her, beat her severely, strangled her with a rope prepared in advance and dropped her body into the river. After that Sergeychik robbed her, and burgled her apartment.

In 2001, Sergeychik assaulted several detainees arrested for drinking alcohol in public places.

His next murder was in September 2002. He worked with an accomplice, his 18-year old nephew Dmitry Barkov. Initially, the criminals drove a car several hours along the streets of Grodno unsuccessfully searching fora  suitable victim. They drove out of town, where they saw a [[VAZ-2106]] [[Zhiguli (car brand)|Zhiguli]] parked near the roadside. Sergeychik and Barkov, armed with Alexander's pistol, approached the car. Sergeychik knocked on the driver's door, after which he demanded that the driver, Viktor Syrytsya, hand over the keys to the car, presenting his service certificate. The driver was shot in the head through the windshield, but survived. Then Sergeychik and Barkov dragged Syrytsya out of the car and beat him to death.

The passenger was Syrenitsa Elena Turchennik. She tried to escape, but Barkov caught her, beat her and dragged her to his car. The criminals then took turns raping her, before Sergeychik strangled her with a cable. They robbed the victims, tied the corpses with a car cable and left them in the car trunk.

In November 2003, Sergeychik, while on duty, beat up a detainee in the workplace and used a gas canister against him, as a result of which he had to call for an ambulance, but the case was ignored.

In February 2005, Sergeychik, in a state of intoxication, quarreled with his wife and came to his friend's mistress Natalia Basis. Earlier his friend and Sergeychik drank alcohol at her apartment. After several hours Sergeychik returned to the apartment, where he beat up the landlady, then raped her, strangling her with her bra and leaving the corpse in the bathroom. He burgled the apartment and fled the scene.

== Arrest and trial ==
After Basis' murder, her friends were investigated, including Sergeychik. By that time he had resigned from internal affairs. He was summoned for interrogation, since his fingerprints were found on the fragments of a bottle that he had broken on Basis' head. Sergeychik tried to deny any connection to the murder, but began to get confused during the testimony and came under suspicion. After the police searched his apartment and garages, item stolen from Kodik's apartment were located, in addition to an arsenal of weapons and other stolen property. In February 2006, the former policeman was charged with two murders and robberies, for which he was imprisoned.

Soon he was charged with four more murders, based on traces of his DNA at the crime scenes. Sergeychik began to confess, admitting to the murders of eleven women and one man. In addition to the proven crimes, Sergeychik confessed to the murders of Olga Geroshchuk, Olga Shor, Elena Runets, Yulia Yatsyshina, Gulnara Azizova and Alexandra Kornat. He confessed that all of them were raped and killed, then either burned or dropped into the Neman. The bodies were never found, so the accusations of these murders were not brought against him.

Psychiatrists concluded that the serial killer was sane.

The trial of Alexander Sergeychik and Dmitry Barkov began on February 20, 2007, in a closed court. Sergeychik was accused of committing murders with "special cruelty to conceal another crime from hooligan motives", rape, theft of property, including theft of firearms, illegal carrying, storage, transportation of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naviny.by/rubrics/disaster/2007/01/26/ic_news_124_266080 Суд над бывшим милиционером, обвиняемом в 12 убийствах, начнется 20 февраля] // Naviny.by. Белорусские новости, 26.01.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2007, Sergeychik was found guilty of all charges, and sentenced to an exceptional penalty by the Grodno District court - death through execution with confiscation of all his property. Dmitry Barkov was sentenced to 10 years in a penal colony.&lt;ref&gt;Дорощёнок Т.

Белорусские новости, 22.05.2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus left the verdict unchanged.

On November 26, 2007, the verdict was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Будкевич В. [http://naviny.by/rubrics/disaster/2007/11/28/ic_articles_124_154186 Бывший милиционер-убийца Сергейчик расстрелян] // Naviny.by. Белорусские новости, 28.11.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences for the Ministry of Internal Affairs ==
Sergeychik's arrest led to a scandal in the law enforcement bodies. On October 28, 2007, President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] signed Decree No. 540 "On incomplete service compliance". For violations of the lawfulness and inaction of this case to strict disciplinary responsibility, according to the Prosecutor General of Belarus Petr Miklashevich, "a number of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and prosecutors have been recruited from the General Prosecutor's Office to the regional district levels".

As a result, the first deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs RB Alexander Shchurko was warned.

Reprimands were given to the State Secretary of the Security Council Viktor Sheiman, Interior Minister Vladimir Naumov, his deputies Viktor Filistovich and Viktor Zhiburtovich, Deputy Prosecutor General Stepan Kosukha and Viktor Prus. Strict reprimands were given to the former head of the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Grodno oblast executive committee, and the deputy of the House of Representatives Anatoliy Beloshevsky, the former first deputy head of the Internal Affairs Director Viktor Zherebilo, the former heads of the Grodno regional administration of the Okhrana association under MVD Vladimir Pekarsky and Ivan Zmurshchik. The former First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikhail Udovikov was deprived of his firearms.

On October 31, 2007, the prosecutor of the Grodno region Vasiliy Litvinov, his deputy Vladimir Onisko and the prosecutor of the Oktyabrsky District of the city of Grodno, Boris Taranko, were relieved from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;Золотницкий А.

==Crimes==
According to Delegacia de Homicídios, Jesus Silva had more than 20 murders in his criminal history, with a further criminal history and records from police stations from [[Ilhéus]] and [[Mata de São João]] and from Grupo Especial de Repressão to Crimes de Extermínio (former Gerce) and Delegacia de Furtos e Roubos. Still according to Delegacia de Homicídios, Jesus Silva was the right-arm of drug trafficker João Teixeira Leal, aka Jão, one of Pirajá's most prolific drug traffickers.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="killed"&gt;[https://extra.globo.com/noticias/brasil/anao-bandido-morto-na-bahia-180552.html Anão bandido morto na Bahia], ''Extra Globo'' (December 3, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Jesus Silva was killed by rival traffickers on December 3, 2010 in Lagoa da Paixão. He had his arms severed, his face disfigured by wood blows. His body was hanging from the head in a trash container. Police suspected that Jesus Silva was killed after he practiced robberies in that region.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="killed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jesus silva"&gt;[http://www.alagoas24horas.com.br/624346/trafico-executa-anao-que-matou-20/ Tráfico executa anão que matou 20], ''Alagoas 24 Horas'' (December 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On December 29, 2011, one of the men accused of killing Jesus Silva, Fabio Cebola, was arrested by police.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bnews.com.br/noticias/policia/policia/26671,policia-prende-traficante-que-volta-ao-local-do-crime.html Polícia prende traficante que volta ao local do crime], ''BNews'' (December 29, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police tales involving Jesus Silva==
One time, to escape police arrest, Jesus Silva hid himself in the housing of a public telephone.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt; Jesus Silva also fired a sub-machine gun from atop the shoulders of a taller accomplice.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jesus silva"/&gt; On one occasion, during a police investigation in a morro in Salvador, several teams were attempting to capture a bandit. By radio, police officers communicated about the operation and the warning that the bandit walked off the morro. Jesus Silva had dribbled the police: When the police officers were discussing if the criminal had escaped, one of the officers said: "Only a dwarf has walked", one police officers responded: "The dwarf was the man!", but Jesus Silva had already escaped.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jesus silva"/&gt;

'''Orlando Sabino Camargo''' (born September 4, 1946 in [[Arapongas]] - June 8, 2013 in [[Barbacena]]), known as the '''"Monster of Capinópolis''', was a [[Brazil]]ian suspected serial killer who allegedly murdered 12 people using revolvers and rifles, as well as beating and stabbing 19 [[calf|calves]] to death using a sickle in the regions of [[Triângulo Mineiro]] and [[Alto Paranaíba]], and in south [[Goiás]]. Aside from this, he was also accused committing numerous crimes related to theft, robbery and rape.

He was described as a short, shallow man with a frightened and introverted look, with features reminiscent of the [[autistic]] spectrum for not reacting to a shot by a nearby officer at the time of his capture.&lt;ref name=monster&gt;[http://www.portaldearaguari.com.br/2011/05/historia-do-monstro-de-capinopolis.html The story of the "Monster of Capinópolis" wins book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414082946/http://www.portaldearaguari.com.br/2011/05/historia-do-monstro-de-capinopolis.html |date=2017-04-14 }} Accessed on July 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories that point at the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|Military Dictatorship]] as responsible for this crimes, which were done on for political reasons, although these theories have never been confirmed. Sabino was considered a symbolic figure in local folklore at the time of his activities, as many people thought he was endowed with supernatural abilities because of his insight, strength and his level of dangerousness.

== Life ==
Orlando Sabino Camargo is said to have been born in Arapongas, in a furniture shop in northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], on September 4, 1946. Son of farmer couple Jorge Francisco and Benedita Rodrigues, he was one of the couple's seven children. He ran away from home in his early twenties after watching his boss murder his father. After traveling for miles, he arrived at the Alto Paranaíba region, where he was accused of practicing robbery in the [[Araxá]] region and murdering in [[Patrocínio]] and [[Coromandel, Minas Gerais|Coromandel]].

He then supposedly went to the south of [[Minas Gerais]], where he allegedly committed homicides in the Davinópolis and Ouvidor regions, afterwards heading to [[Tupaciguara]], [[Centralina, Minas Gerais|Centralina]], [[Capinópolis]] and [[Canápolis]]. Sabino was known for invading farms and spending long periods free of human contact, sneaking through the bushes.

He was captured in [[Ipiaçu]] on the banks of the Tejuco River in Minas Gerais, after seventeen days of persecution in the largest manhunt ever held in the state, with two hundred policemen patrolling the areas.&lt;ref name=monster/&gt;

In 1972, he was hospitalized in an asylum and diagnosed with an [[intellectual disability]], being released after completing his 38 years and 6 months sentence in the Judicial Hospital of Professor Mario Vaz. On April 1, 2011, he was admitted to an [[almshouse]] for the elderly.

== Death ==
He was found dead the morning of June 8, 2013, in a nursing home in the municipality of Barbacena, Minas Gerais, by one of the staff. A [[heart attack]] waws identified as the cause of death.

His body is buried in the Santo Antônio cemetery in Barbacena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogdoroque.com.br/2013/09/26/homem-conhecido-como-mostro-de-capinopolis-e-com-familiares-em-sao-joao-do-ivai-morre-em-minas-gerais/]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Documentary ==
Despite the great controversy surrounding Orlando Sabino - where many claim that he was a murderous monster and others claim that he only the victim of the Military Regime - the newspaper ''Todo Em Dia'' produced a documentary based on the book [https://www.tudoemdia.com/2018/05/documentario-orlando-sabino-o-monstro-de-capinopolis/ "The Monster of Capinópolis"] by journalist Pedro Popó.

===Murrumbidgee River victim===
On October 19, 1888, a Mr. R. Whittaker was fishing in the [[Murrumbidgee River]], when he chanced upon the headless, naked body of a man stuffed into a log. He quickly contacted authorities, and they quickly began investigating the mysterious death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/128765264?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Gundagai Police Report|publisher=The Gundagai Times and Tumut, Adelong and Murrumbidgee District Advertiser|date=October 18, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man was young, rather short (1.62 meters tall) and had several pieces of flesh hanging from his body, suggesting he had put up a fierce struggle with his killer.&lt;ref name=murrum&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/47044718?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Murder at Murrumbidgee|publisher=[[South Australian Register]]|date=October 20, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was decapitated post-mortem with two distinct cuts,&lt;ref name=murrum/&gt; but neither the head, nor the clothes could be located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/108116260?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=A Headless Body.|publisher=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|date=October 20, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several inquiries by Constable Nixon, nobody reported a missing person from the surrounding area, suggesting that the deceased might've been a foreigner, possibly a labourer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228416029?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Supposed Murder near Gundagai|publisher=[[The Australian Star]]|date=October 22, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, when Schmidt was arrested for Taylor's murder, it was discovered that during the supposed time frame of the murder, he had been employed near Murrumbidgee as a fisherman. Additionally, William Givney, owner of the ''Coach and Horses'' hotel, recognized Schmidt as a man who had checked into his hotel shortly before the murder had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/101894490|title=The Late Wagga Murder|publisher=[[The Daily Advertiser (Wagga Wagga)|The Wagga Wagga Advertiser]]|date=May 15, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacob Rick===
A 54-year-old native of [[Hochkirch]], [[Prussia]], Rick had been in Australia since 1870. He was described as short, stout, of ruddy complexion, with a high forehead, black curly hair, a deformity on the left side of his [[crown (anatomy)|crown]] and with a full black beard. A resident of [[Rushworth, Victoria]], he initially had a successful job as a miner before turning towards [[prospecting]]. As he was a very steady and industrious man, which presumably made him lots of money, he got himself acquainted with John Young Taylor, Schmidt's future victim.&lt;ref name=sup&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8607304?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Supposed Murder of Jacob Rick|publisher=The Argus|date=May 21, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men travelled to [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]] on October 23, 1889, where he withdrew 30 dollars. As Taylor had paid for both's expenses, it is assumed that Rick was in a dire financial situation. Disappointed by the false advertisement of the situation in the area, the duo moved to Lambing Flats, where they met with Albert Schmidt. After prospecting for some time, Taylor left for Rushworth in December, leaving Rick and Schmidt in Lambing Flats.&lt;ref name=sup/&gt; He took some of Jacob's items and brought them to his friends, telling them that he would come back soon and would definitely write to them.&lt;ref name=con&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197018341?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Country News: Rushworth|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=April 18, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick was last seen alive on [[New Year's Eve]] in [[Wee Jasper, New South Wales|Wee Jasper]], accompanied by Schmidt, on a horse-drawn carriage.&lt;ref name=arg&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8606788?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Smidt, The Wagga Murderer|publisher=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|date=May 17, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Schmidt returned to Wee Jasper on January 3, he was asked by various people about Rick's whereabouts. Albert (who presented himself as "Alfred Smitz", from [[Hamburg]]), gave various explanations,&lt;ref name=arg/&gt; including that he was in a [[gold rush]].&lt;ref name=con/&gt; In the meantime, he disposed of the carriage and the horse. When Taylor returned, Schmidt reunited with and followed John everywhere, eagerly convincing him to leave Rushworth for [[Tumbarumba]], where he claimed they could find lots of gold. He was so anxious about it, that he even helped a local firm repair Taylor's wagon for 10 days, and when questioned about Rick, he claimed that he had been left behind in [[Albury]]. The duo then promptly left the area.&lt;ref name=sup/&gt;

When the news about Taylor's murder spread, suspicion fell on Schmidt concerning Rick's disappearance. Mounted police and [[aboriginal tracker]]s were dispatched towards Wee Jasper in search of Rick's body, which was believed to have been buried somewhere in the outback.&lt;ref name=arg/&gt; Although the body was never located, Schmidt was connected to his murder through Jacob's silver watch, which was found to be in his former companion's possession.&lt;ref name=mel&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/159546568?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Murder Near Wagga: Melbourne section|publisher=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Adelaide Observer]]|date=May 3, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being questioned by Rev. John McIntyre in order to confess to the killing, Schmidt wasn't persuaded to do so, but suspiciously remarked that "it was enough to die for one man."&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;&lt;ref name=arg/&gt;

===John Young Taylor===
On April 7, 1890, Schmidt and Taylor were both seen together at Junee, mucking about. In the following hours, multiple witnesses observed Taylor become increasingly intoxicated with brandy in several establishments, with his friend Schmidt only having small pints of [[shandygaff]]. Eventually, they were last seen in a hotel in [[Alfredtown]], and after they left, they in the direction of a mutual friend named King. On the way in the wagon, the drunken Taylor mocked Albert and called him a liar, whom initially refused to retaliate. In the heat of the moment, Schmidt grabbed a tomahawk and hit John on the head, causing him to fall out of the wagon.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt; Quickly realising that he had died, Schmidt panicked, wondering where he would hide the body out in the open. After deliberating for some time, he eventually bought a shovel from a store near Old Junee and decided to bury him near a railroad. He noticed some men working nearby, so he camped until nighttime, when he stripped the bloodied clothes off the corpse and cut the throat. At some point, he heard a crack, which came from the neck. In order not to have Taylor's body identified, he decapitated him, burying the body and head in different locations before burning the clothes and washing the wagon off in a nearby spring.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt;

After concealing his crime, Schmidt decided to go to Wagga Wagga, where he would confess his sins before a clergyman and then end his life. Before that, he would write down a confession in his notebook about the killing. While travelling along the Junee road, he came across two policemen, who noticed blood dripping off the wagon. Frozen in fear, Schmidt was arrested and put on the wagon so he could be driven back to the police station. On the way, he unsuccessfully tried to cut his throat with a razor and then a penknife, but was prevented; a bit later on, when he came to his senses, he grabbed his revolver and tried to fire it, initially unsuccessfully, and afterwards firing a non-lethal shot into his mouth. He was then sent off to the hospital, where he directed the authorities to the body's location. After his recovery, he was sent to the prison lock-up, where he was later visited by Rev. John McIntyre for an interview, in which he broke down and wept on several occasions.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt;

==Trial, sentence and execution==
More than a month after his arrest, Schmidt's trial began. Multiple witnesses were called and plenty of evidence was produced, with Schmidt himself giving a written statement of the crime, which was read out to the court judge by Inspector Harrison. The jury gave a verdict of wilful murder, and Schmidt's trial before the [[assizes]] was scheduled for September 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/138848821?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Wagga Tragedy|publisher=[[The Newcastle Herald|The Newcastle Morning Herald]]|date=April 30, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded not guilty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227465324?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=WAGGA WAGGA MURDER.|publisher=[[The Australian Star]]|date=September 26, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was again found guilty and [[sentenced to death]], to which he expressed no discernible emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227475957?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Wagga Wagga Murder|publisher=The Australian Star|date=September 30, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the gallows where prepared for Schmidt, he appeared shattered, yet accepting of, his eventual faith.&lt;ref name=fai&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227470586?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Preparations for the Execution.|publisher=The Australian Star|date=November 15, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the date of his execution, the pale Albert ate a couple of eggs and had a cup of tea, shook the hands of all the attending workers and then stepped upon the scaffold, where Archdeacon Pownall read his prayers.&lt;ref name=exe/&gt; Choosing not to make a statement about his crimes, Schmidt shook hands with the minister before the executioner, Robert Howard,&lt;ref name=fai/&gt; the bolt was drawn and he was let down, dying almost instantaneously. After the body was left hanging for about half an hour, it was put in a coffin and buried in the prison cemetery.&lt;ref name=exe/&gt;
