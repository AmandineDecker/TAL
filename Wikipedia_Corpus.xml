The '''Stoneman''' is a name given by the popular English-language print media of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[India]] to an unidentified [[serial killer]] who murdered at least 13 homeless people of that city during their sleep in 1989. The name is also given to the perpetrator of a similar series of murders in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] from 1985 to 1988. It has been speculated that these were the work of the same person, who could have been responsible for as many as 26 murders.

The Stoneman was blamed for thirteen murders over six months (the first in June 1989), but it was never established whether the crimes were committed by one person or a group of individuals. The [[Kolkata Police Force|Calcutta Police]] also failed to resolve whether any of the crimes were committed as a [[copycat crimes|copycat murder]]. To date, no one has been charged with any of the crimes; all thirteen cases remain unsolved.

==Bombay killings==
The first hint of a [[serial-killer]] who was targeting homeless ragpickers and beggars in India came from [[Bombay]]. Starting in 1985, and lasting well over two years, a series of twelve murders were committed in the [[Sion, India|Sion]] and [[King's Circle]] locality of the city. The criminal or criminals' ''modus operandi'' was simple: first they would find an unsuspecting victim sleeping alone in a desolate area. The victim's head was crushed with a single stone weighing as much as 30&amp;nbsp;kg (~66 lbs). In most cases, the victims' identities could not be ascertained since they slept alone and did not have relatives or associates who could identify them. Compounded to this was the fact that the victims were people of very simple means and the individual crimes were not high-profile. It was after the sixth murder that the [[Bombay Police]] began to see a pattern in the crimes.

A stroke of luck seemed to come the police's way when a homeless waiter survived a brutal attack and managed to escape being bludgeoned to death. However, in the dimly lit area of Sion where he was sleeping, he had not been able to get a good look at his assailant, and what seemed like a big break came to naught.

Shortly afterwards, in 1987, a [[ragpicker]] was hacked to death in the adjoining suburb of [[Matunga]]. Even though the police and the media were quick to label this the handiwork of the same person, no evidence to link this crime with the others was ever found.

As mysteriously as the killings had started, by the middle of 1988, they stopped. To this date the case is unsolved.

==Summer of 1989 in Calcutta==
Whether or not the Bombay killings were linked to the Calcutta "Stoneman" killings has never been confirmed. However, the uncanny similarity in the instrument, choice of victims, execution, and the time of the attacks suggests the assailant(s) was familiar with the Bombay episodes, if not the same killer himself.

The first victim in Calcutta died from injuries to the head in June 1989. Twelve more would die in the next six months as panic gripped the city. All of the murdered were homeless pavement-dwellers who slept alone in dimly lit areas of the city. Most of the murders took place in central Calcutta, adjoining the [[Howrah Bridge]].&lt;ref name="ghoshhtimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ghosh |first1=Ritujay |title=The elusive stoneman of Kolkata |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/the-elusive-stoneman-of-kolkata/story-BQBcCHfk87WvoLp2LSCKRN.html |website=HinduSan Stimes.com |publisher=Ritujay Ghosh |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the murderer killed victims by dropping a heavy stone or concrete slab, the police assumed that the assailant was probably a tall, well-built male. However, in the complete absence of any eyewitnesses or survivors, no clear-cut leads were available.

Massive deployments of police in various parts of the city at night were resorted to, and numerous arrests were made. After a spell of arrests in which a handful of "suspicious persons" were rounded up for questioning, the killings stopped. However, since there was no incriminating evidence, all those summarily arrested had to be released. To date, the crimes remain unsolved.

==Stoneman in Guwahati==
Similar incidents were reported in [[Guwahati]] city of [[Assam]] state during February 2009.

==Film adaptations based upon the events==
Producer [[Bobby Bedi]] produced a film titled ''[[The Stoneman Murders]]'' based on these incidents. The film released on 13 February 2009, starring [[Kay Kay Menon]] and [[Arbaaz Khan]], and written and directed by [[Manish Gupta (director)|Manish Gupta]]. Gupta said that his story for the movie is 40% fact and 60% fiction. The movie depicts the killings to be a part of a religious ritual being conducted by a policeman, with the actual perpetrator left open to interpretation at the end.

In 2011, a Bengali film named ''[[Baishe Srabon]]'' released which was directed by Srijit Mukherjee. The plot of the movie revolved around the same mysterious serial killings in Kolkata, which took place during the period of 1989. In the movie, the assassin is shown to brutally murder and the victims mostly belonged to the ignoble and the plebeian league of the society; either prostitutes, anti-socials or street dwellers. However, the climax of the movie saw the serial killer shooting himself after confessing all his crudities, which, in fact, is a clear deviation from the actual incident.

'''Peter William Sutcliffe''' (born 2 June 1946), also known as '''Peter William Coonan''', is a prolific English [[serial killer]] who was dubbed the ’'''Yorkshire Ripper'''’ by the press. On 22 May 1981, Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others. He is serving 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]], which was increased to a [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales#Whole life order|whole life order]] in 2010. All except two of his murders took place in [[West Yorkshire]]; the others were in [[Manchester]].

Sutcliffe initially attacked women and girls in residential areas, but appeared to have moved to [[red light district]]s because he was attracted by the vulnerability of prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;The Yorkshire Ripper Files:A Very British Crime Story, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date= 27 March 2019 |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/crime/the-yorkshire-ripper-files-why-chapeltown-in-leeds-was-the-hunting-ground-of-peter-sutcliffe-1-9673863|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Files: Why Chapeltown in Leeds was the 'hunting ground' of Peter Sutcliffe|accessdate=28 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe had allegedly regularly used the services of prostitutes in [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]]. He carried out murders over five years, including women who were not prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cross| first = Roger| title = Yorkshire Ripper| year = 1981| publisher = HarperCollins UK| isbn = 978-0-586-05526-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/144 144]| url = https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/144}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest in [[Sheffield]] by [[South Yorkshire Police]] for driving with false [[Vehicle registration plate|number plate]]s in January 1981, he was transferred to [[West Yorkshire Police]], who questioned him about the killings. He confessed to being the perpetrator, saying that the voice of God had sent him on a mission to kill prostitutes. At his trial, Sutcliffe pleaded not guilty to murder on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]], but he was convicted of murder on a majority verdict. Following his conviction, Sutcliffe began using his mother's maiden name of Coonan.

West Yorkshire Police were criticised for their failure to catch Sutcliffe despite having interviewed him nine times in the course of their five-year investigation. Because of the sensational nature of the case, the police handled an exceptional amount of information, some of it misleading (including the [[Wearside Jack]] hoax recorded message and letters purporting to be from the "Ripper"). Following Sutcliffe's conviction, the government ordered a review of the investigation, conducted by [[Lawrence Byford]], known as the "Byford Report". The findings were made fully public in 2006 and confirmed the validity of the criticism against the force. The report led to changes to investigative procedures which were adopted across UK police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-43030591|title=Sir Lawrence Byford: Yorkshire Ripper report author dies|website=[[BBC News]]|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the manhunt as "stunningly mishandled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/27/the-yorkshire-ripper-files-a-very-british-crime-story-review-a-stunningly-mismanaged-manhunt|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Files review – a stunningly mishandled manhunt|website=[[The Guardian]]|first=Tim|last=Dowling|date=27 March 2019|accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe was transferred from prison to a [[Broadmoor Hospital|high-security psychiatric hospital]] in March 1984 after being diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12027015/Yorkshire-Ripper-Peter-Sutcliffe-was-never-mentally-ill-claims-detective-who-hunted-him.html|title=Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe 'was never mentally ill' claims detective who hunted him|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=16 October 2019|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] dismissed an appeal by Sutcliffe in 2010, confirming that he would serve a whole life order and never be released from custody. In August 2016, it was ruled that Sutcliffe was mentally fit to be returned to prison, and he was transferred that month to [[HM Prison Frankland]] in [[County Durham|Durham]].

==Early life==
Sutcliffe was born in [[Bingley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] to a [[working-class]] family. He was given a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] upbringing by his parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yallop|first=David|title=Deliver us from Evil|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H7_QBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT210|year=2014|publisher=Constable &amp; Robinson Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1-47211-658-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (née Coonan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|title=A Killer's Mask|work=trutv.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html|archivedate=21 March 2009|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a [[gravedigger]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Stephen|title=Who is the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe?

After leaving Baird Television, Sutcliffe worked nightshifts at the Britannia Works of Anderton International from April 1973. In February 1975, he took [[Voluntary Redundancy|redundancy]] and used half of the £400 pay-off to train as a [[Large Goods Vehicle|heavy goods vehicle (HGV)]] driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gordon |last=Burn |authorlink=Gordon Burn |year=1993 |title=Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son: The Story of Peter Sutcliffe |publisher=Mandarin |isbn=978-0-7493-1331-9 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 1976, he was dismissed for the theft of used tyres.

Sutcliffe, by some reports, used prostitutes as a young man, and it has been speculated that he had a bad experience, during which he was conned out of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm "Peter Sutcliffe: The Yorkshire Ripper – Famous Criminal"], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620054640/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/famous_criminal/54/biography/1/Peter_Sutcliffe_The_Yorkshire_Ripper.htm |date=20 June 2008 }} ''Crime And Investigation Network''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}} Other analyses of his actions have not found evidence that he actually sought their services, although he clearly expressed unusual behaviour{{clarify|reason=Expressed? + What behaviour?|date=June 2018}} before the killings.&lt;ref name=grisly/&gt;

Sutcliffe met [[Sonia Sutcliffe|Sonia Szurma]] on [[St Valentine's Day|14 February]] 1967; they married on 10 August 1974. She suffered several miscarriages and they were informed that she would not be able to have children. She resumed a teacher training course, during which time she had an affair with an ice-cream van driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial03.htm|title=THE TRIAL: WEEK ONE|website=www.execulink.com|access-date=2020-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she completed the course in 1977 and began teaching, she and Sutcliffe used her salary to buy a house in [[Heaton, West Yorkshire|Heaton]], [[Bradford]], into which they moved on 26 September 1977, and where they were living at the time of Sutcliffe's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html "Peter Sutcliffe" "A Killer's Mask"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321003633/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/mask_1.html |date=21 March 2009 }}, by Fiona Steel for Trutv.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his childhood and his early adolescence, Sutcliffe showed no signs of abnormality. Later, in part related to his occupation as a gravedigger, he developed a macabre sense of humour. In his late adolescence, he developed a growing obsession with voyeurism and spent much time spying on prostitutes and the men seeking their services.&lt;ref name=grisly&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Serial Killer Investigations: The Grisly Business Unit|author1=Robert D.

==Attacks and murders==

===1969===
Sutcliffe assaulted a prostitute he had met while searching for a woman who had tricked him out of money. He left his friend Trevor Birdsall's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, as if he had been running. He told Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it".&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim01.htm |title=Stone-in-sock attack |publisher=Execulink.com |date=29 September 1969 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police visited his home the next day, as the woman he had attacked had noted Birdsall's [[vehicle registration plate]]. Sutcliffe admitted he had hit her, but claimed it was with his hand. The police told him he was "very lucky", as the woman did not want anything more to do with the incident – she was a known prostitute, and her husband was serving a jail term for assault.&lt;ref name="Execulink.com website"/&gt;

===1975===
Sutcliffe committed his second assault on the night of 5 July 1975 in [[Keighley]]. He attacked Anna Rogulskyj, who was walking alone, striking her unconscious with a [[ball-peen hammer]] and slashing her stomach with a knife. Disturbed by a neighbour, he left without killing her. Rogulskyj survived after extensive medical intervention but was [[Psychological trauma|psychologically traumatised]] by the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html TruTV.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001184952/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/sutcliffe/life_2.html |date=1 October 2012 }} Fiona Steel; retrieved 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked Olive Smelt in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in August. Employing the same ''[[modus operandi]]'', he struck her from behind and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered from emotional and mental health problems, including [[clinical depression]]. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in [[Silsden]]. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a country lane. He ran off when he saw the lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Yallop|Yallop, David]].

The first victim to lose her life in a Sutcliffe attack was Wilma McCann on 30 October. McCann, from [[Scott Hall, Leeds|Scott Hall]] in [[Leeds]], was a mother of four. Sutcliffe struck her twice with a hammer before stabbing her 15 times in the neck, chest and abdomen. An extensive inquiry, involving 150 police officers and 11,000 interviews, failed to find the culprit. One of McCann's daughters died by suicide in December 2007, reportedly after suffering years of depression over her mother's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stratton, Allegra.

===1976===
Sutcliffe committed his next murder in Leeds in January 1976, when he stabbed 42-year-old Emily Jackson 52 times. In dire financial straits, Jackson had been using the family van to exchange sexual favours for money. Sutcliffe picked up Jackson who was soliciting outside the Gaiety pub on Roundhay Road, he then drove about half a mile to some derelict buildings on Enfield Terrace in the Manor Industrial Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm|title=THE ATTACKS AND MURDERS – EMILY JACKSON|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe hit her on the head with a hammer, and then dragged her body into a rubbish strewn yard and used a sharpened screwdriver to stab her in the neck, chest and abdomen. Sutcliffe stomped on her thigh, leaving behind an impression of his boot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim07.htm |title=Emily Jackson |publisher=Execulink.com |date=20 January 1976 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe attacked 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in [[Roundhay Park]], Leeds, on 9 May. Walking home from a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out of the car to urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At the time of this attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1977===
On 5 February Sutcliffe attacked Irene Richardson, a [[Chapeltown, Leeds|Chapeltown]] sex worker, in Roundhay Park. Richardson was bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Once she was dead, he mutilated her corpse with a knife. Tyre&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in this sentence --&gt; tracks left near the murder scene resulted in a long list of possible suspect vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0586-05526-7}} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, on 23 April, Sutcliffe killed Patricia "Tina" Atkinson, a sex worker from Bradford, in her flat, where police found a bootprint on the bedclothes. Two months later on 26 June, he murdered 16-year-old Jayne MacDonald in Chapeltown. She was not a sex worker and, in the public perception, showed that all women were potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim11.htm |title=Jayne MacDonald |publisher=Execulink.com |date=26 June 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe seriously assaulted Maureen Long in Bradford in July. He was interrupted and left her for dead. A witness misidentified the make of his car. More than 300 police officers collected 12,500 statements and checked thousands of cars, without success. On 1 October 1977 Sutcliffe murdered Jean Jordan, a sex worker from [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Cross| first = Roger| title = Yorkshire Ripper| year = 1981| publisher = HarperCollins UK| isbn = 978-0-586-05526-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/92 92]| url = https://archive.org/details/yorkshireripper00cros/page/92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a confession, Sutcliffe said he had realised the new £5 note he had given her was traceable. After hosting a family party at his new home, he returned to the wasteland behind Manchester's [[Southern Cemetery, Manchester|Southern Cemetery]], where he had left the body, to retrieve the note. Unable to find it, he mutilated Jordan's corpse and moved it.&lt;ref name="execulink.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim13.htm |title=Jean Jordan |publisher=Execulink.com |date=1 October 1977 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October, Jordan's body was discovered by local dairy worker and future actor [[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bruce-jones-les-battersby-actor-2013816 |title = Bruce Jones: Les Battersby actor reveals depression drove him to try to kill himself and his wife|date = 30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had an allotment on land adjoining the site where the body was found and was searching for house bricks when he made the discovery. The £5 note, hidden in a secret compartment in Jordan's handbag, was traced to branches of the [[Midland Bank]] in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]] and [[Bingley]]. Police analysis of bank operations allowed them to narrow their field of inquiry to 8,000 employees who could have received it in their wage packet. Over three months the police interviewed 5,000 men, including Sutcliffe. The police found that the alibi given for Sutcliffe's whereabouts was credible; he had indeed spent much of the evening of the killing at a family party. Weeks of intense investigations pertaining to the origins of the £5 note led to nothing, leaving police officers frustrated that they collected an important clue, but had been unable to trace the actual firm (or employee within the firm) to which the note had been issued.&lt;ref name=shook&gt;"The Yorkshire Ripper". ''Crimes That Shook Britain'': Season 4, Episode 4. (6 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December, Sutcliffe attacked Marilyn Moore, another sex worker from Leeds. She survived and provided police with a description of her attacker.&lt;!-- Please retain British English spelling 'tyre' in following sentence --&gt; Tyre tracks found at the scene matched those from an earlier attack.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

===1978===
The police discontinued the search for the person who received the £5 note in January 1978. Although Sutcliffe was interviewed about it, he was not investigated further (he was contacted and disregarded by the Ripper Squad on several further occasions). That month, Sutcliffe killed again. His victim was Yvonne Pearson, a 21-year-old prostitute from Bradford. He repeatedly bludgeoned her about the head with a ball-peen hammer then jumped on her chest before stuffing horse-hair into her mouth from a discarded sofa under which he hid her body near Lumb Lane.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was not found until 26 March.

Ten days later, he killed Helen Rytka, an 18-year-old sex worker from [[Huddersfield]]. He struck Rytka on the head five times as she exited his vehicle, before stripping most of the clothes from her body (although her bra and polo-neck jumper were positioned above her breasts), before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest. Her body was found three days later beneath railway arches in Garrards timber-yard to which he had driven her.&lt;ref&gt;''The Yorkshire Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-0-586-05526-7}} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May, Sutcliffe killed Vera Millward in an attack in the car park of [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/victim17.htm |title=website |publisher=Execulink.com |date=16 May 1978 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1979===
On 4 April 1979, Sutcliffe killed Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old building society clerk whom he attacked on Savile Park Moor in Halifax as she was walking home. Despite forensic evidence, police efforts were diverted for several months following receipt of a taped message purporting to be from the murderer taunting Assistant Chief Constable [[George Oldfield (detective)|George Oldfield]], who was leading the investigation. The tape contained a man's voice saying "I'm Jack. I see you're having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord, you're no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started."&lt;ref&gt;''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes'' by Martin Fido&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the recorded message, police began searching for a man with a [[Wearside]] accent, which linguists narrowed down to the [[Castletown, Tyne and Wear|Castletown]] area of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The hoaxer, dubbed "[[Wearside Jack]]", sent two letters to police and ''The Daily Mirror'' in March 1978 boasting of his crimes. The letters, signed "[[Jack the Ripper]]", claimed responsibility for the murder of 26-year-old Joan Harrison in [[City of Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in November 1975. At the time, police mistakenly believed that the Preston murder was not public knowledge.
The hoaxer case was re-opened in 2005, and DNA taken from envelopes was entered into the national database. On 20 October 2005, John Samuel Humble, an unemployed alcoholic and long-time resident of the [[Ford Estate]] in Sunderland – a few miles from Castletown – was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice for sending the hoax letters and tape. Humble, whose DNA had been taken following a drunk and disorderly offence in 2001, was remanded in custody and on 21 March 2006 was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Ian|title=Wearside Jack: I deserve to go to jail for 'evil' Ripper hoax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wearside-jack-i-deserve-to-go-to-jail-for-evil-ripper-hoax-6106028.html|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humble died on 30 July 2019, aged 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-49406231 |title=Yorkshire Ripper hoaxer Wearside Jack dies |publisher=BBC |date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, Sutcliffe murdered 20-year-old Barbara Leach, a [[University of Bradford|Bradford University]] student. Her body was dumped at the rear of 13 Ashgrove under a pile of bricks, close to the university and her lodgings. It was his 16th attack. The murder of a woman who was not a sex worker again alarmed the public and prompted an expensive publicity campaign emphasising the Wearside connection. Despite the false lead, Sutcliffe was interviewed on at least two other occasions in 1979. Despite matching several forensic clues and being on the list of 300 names in connection with the £5 note, he was not strongly suspected. Sutcliffe was interviewed by police nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/intervws.htm |title=Vera Millward |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980===
In April 1980 Sutcliffe was arrested for drunk driving. While awaiting trial, he killed two more women. He murdered 47-year-old Marguerite Walls on the night of 20 August, and 20-year-old Jacqueline Hill, a student at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]], on the night of 17 November. Hill's body was found in the grounds of the Lupton Residences. He attacked three other women who survived; Uphadya Bandara in Leeds on 24 September, Maureen Lea (known as Mo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cocozza|first=Paula|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/dec/05/mo-lea-artist-yorkshire-ripper-peter-sutcliffe|title='I've turned the tables on Peter Sutcliffe': artist Mo Lea on why she finally drew her attacker|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2017|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an art student attacked in the grounds of Leeds University on 25 October and 16-year-old Theresa Sykes, attacked in Huddersfield on the night of 5 November. On 25 November Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe, reported him to the police as a suspect but the information vanished into the paperwork already accumulated.&lt;ref name="who is Peter Sutcliffe"/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:Milgarth Police Station, Leeds.jpg|thumb|right|Millgarth Police Station in [[Leeds city centre]], now demolished, where the Yorkshire Ripper police investigation was conducted.]]

On 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe was stopped by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the driveway of Light Trades House in Melbourne Avenue, [[Broomhill (ward)|Broomhill]], [[Sheffield]]. A police check by probationary constable Robert Hydes revealed his car had false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested and transferred to [[Dewsbury]] Police Station. At Dewsbury he was questioned in relation to the Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. The next day police returned to the scene of the arrest and discovered a knife, hammer and rope he had discarded when he briefly slipped away from the police after telling them he was "bursting for a pee". Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. The police obtained a [[search warrant]] for his home at 6 Garden Lane in Heaton, Bradford and brought his wife in for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/arrest.htm |title=Arrest and confession |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sutcliffe was stripped at the police station he was wearing an inverted V-neck sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 publication of the book, ''Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper'', by Michael Bilton. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when talking of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, he vehemently denied responsibility. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the "Wearside Jack" claim, and in 2011, [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]] demonstrated the crime had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who had died in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DNA helps police 'solve' 1975 Joan Harrison murder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-12396506|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe was charged on 5 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/confessn.htm |title=Statement |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial, he pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]] on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]]. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe said he had heard voices that ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from the headstone of a Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial04.htm "The Trial: Week Two"], Trial of Peter Sutcliffe&lt;/ref&gt; and that the voices were that of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2833589.stm "MP's Ripper prison demand"], ''BBC World News''. 9 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120527001131/http://www.crimeandjustice.us/forums/lofiversion/index.php?t6951.html "Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe's Weight-Gain Strategy in Latest Bid for Freedom"], ''New Criminologist''. 25 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He pleaded guilty to seven charges of attempted murder. The prosecution intended to accept Sutcliffe's plea after four psychiatrists diagnosed him with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] but the trial judge, Justice Sir [[Leslie Boreham]], demanded an unusually detailed explanation of the prosecution reasoning. After a two-hour representation by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] [[Michael Havers|Sir Michael Havers]], a 90-minute lunch break and another 40&amp;nbsp;minutes of legal discussion, the judge rejected the diminished responsibility plea and the expert testimonies of the psychiatrists, insisting that the case should be dealt with by a jury. The trial proper was set to commence on 5 May 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial01.htm Execulink.com website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/trial03.htm |title=Trial: week 1 |publisher=Execulink.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted two weeks and despite the efforts of his counsel [[James Chadwin|James Chadwin QC]], Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to 20 concurrent sentences of [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/22/newsid_2504000/2504409.stm "1981: Yorkshire Ripper jailed for life"] BBC On This Day, 22 May&lt;/ref&gt; The jury rejected the evidence of four psychiatrists that Sutcliffe had paranoid schizophrenia, possibly influenced by the evidence of a prison officer who heard him say to his wife that if he convinced people he was mad then he might get ten years in a "loony bin".&lt;ref&gt;Smith p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge said Sutcliffe was beyond redemption, and hoped he would never leave prison. He recommended a minimum term of 30 years to be served before parole could be considered meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16 July 2010, the [[High Court]] issued Sutcliffe with a [[whole life tariff]], meaning he is unlikely ever to be released. The whole life tariff was introduced by the government in 1983, and over the next 20 years it was reported that Sutcliffe was among the small group of prisoners to have been issued with a whole life tariff. Politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners in November 2002, and the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner can serve has since rested with the High Court.

After his trial, Sutcliffe admitted two other attacks. It was decided that prosecution for these offences was "not in the public interest". [[West Yorkshire Police]] made it clear that the victims wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/otherv.htm |title=OTHER YORKSHIRE RIPPER VICTIMS?|publisher=Execulink.com |accessdate= 25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of West Yorkshire Police==
West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1982-01-19/debates/f9d9628e-7756-4e42-b6ed-877b25bea741/LordsChamber |title=The Yorkshire Ripper Case |last=Ganzoni |first=John |authorlink=John Ganzoni, 2nd Baron Belstead |date=19 January 1982 |website=House of Lords Hansard |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=2 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34615802|title=One Girl's Life in the Ripper Years|accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=BBC|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. The 1982 Byford report into the investigation concluded 'The ineffectiveness of the major incident room was a serious handicap to the Ripper investigation. While it should have been the effective nerve centre of the whole police operation, the backlog of unprocessed information resulted in the failure to connect vital pieces of related information. This serious fault in the central index system allowed Peter Sutcliffe to continually slip through the net'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/byfdsamp.htm|title=BYFORD AND SAMPSON REPORTS|website=www.execulink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/15/story-of-yorkshire-ripper-hoaxer-wearside-jack-to-be-made-into-movie|title=Story of Yorkshire Ripper Hoaxer 'Wearside Jack' to be Made into Movie |accessdate=26 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the [[FBI]], plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis,&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that "Wearside Jack" was a blatant hoaxer.{{refn|group=n|George Oldfield and other senior individuals involved in the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper had consulted senior [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]]s [[John E. Douglas|John Douglas]] and [[Robert Ressler]] in an effort to construct a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the Yorkshire Ripper in 1979. After playing the hoax tape to Ressler and Douglas, Ressler said to Oldfield: "You do realise, of course, that the man on the tape is not the killer, don't you?" Oldfield chose to ignore this observation.&lt;ref&gt;Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp. 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;}} The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The "Wearside Jack" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the [[Home Office Large Major Enquiry System]], the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In response to the police reaction to the murders, the [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]] organised a number of '[[Reclaim the Night]]' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence.&lt;ref&gt;Serial Murderers {{ISBN|1-85435-834-0}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in ''[[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire]]''.  The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that the [[Chief Constable]] of West Yorkshire did not owe a [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]] to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the [[Caparo test|''Caparo'' test]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjudgmt/jd050421/brooks-1.htm "Judgments – Brooks (FC) (Respondent) v.

==Byford Report==
The [[Inspector of Constabulary]] Sir Lawrence Byford's 1981 report of an official inquiry into the Ripper case was not released by the Home Office until 1 June 2006. The sections  "Description of suspects, photofits and other assaults" and parts of the section on Sutcliffe's "immediate associates" were not disclosed by the Home Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/mistakes-that-left-ripper-on-the-loose-1-2372470|title= Mistakes that left Ripper on the loose|work=The Yorkshire Post|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the period between 1969, when Sutcliffe first came to the attention of police, and 1975, the year of the murder of Wilma McCann, the report states: "There is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities" and "it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country".&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Rob|last2=Campbell|first2=Duncan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jun/02/freedomofinformation.ukcrime|title=Ripper guilty of additional crimes, says secret report|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 Sutcliffe, described in the Byford Report as an "otherwise unremarkable young man", came to the notice of police on two occasions over incidents with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/ripper-may-have-attacked-more/2006/06/02/1148956547934.html|title=Ripper may have attacked more|work=Sydney Morning Herald|agency=Reuters|date=3 June 2006|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norfolk|first=Andrew|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article2461911.ece|title=Peter Sutcliffe, the bullied mummy's boy who gave millions nightmares|work=The Times|location=London|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also arrested in Bradford's [[red light district]] for being in possession of a hammer, an offensive weapon, but he was charged with "going equipped for stealing" as it was assumed he was a potential burglar.&lt;ref name="home office"&gt;"Sir Lawrence Byford report into the police handling of the Yorkshire Ripper case", ''Home Office''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; The report said that it was clear he had on at least one occasion attacked a Bradford sex worker with a [[Club (weapon)|cosh]].&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Byford's report states:

{{quote|We feel it is highly improbable that the crimes in respect of which Sutcliffe has been charged and convicted are the only ones attributable to him. This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffe's overall modus operandi. I hasten to add that I feel sure that the senior police officers in the areas concerned are also mindful of this possibility but, in order to ensure full account is taken of all the information available, I have arranged for an effective liaison to take place.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

Police identified a number of attacks which matched Sutcliffe's modus operandi and tried to question the killer, but he was never charged with other crimes.

The Byford Report's major findings were contained in a summary published by the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Whitelaw]], the first time precise details of the bungled police investigation had been disclosed. Sir Lawrence described delays in following up vital tip-offs from Trevor Birdsall, an associate of Sutcliffe since 1966. On 25 November 1980, Birdsall sent an anonymous letter to police, the text of which ran as follows:

{{quote|I have good reason to {{sic|now}} the man you are looking for in the Ripper case. This man {{sic|as|nolink=yes}} dealings with prostitutes and always had a thing about them… His name and address is Peter Sutcliffe, {{sic|5|nolink=yes}} Garden Lane, Heaton, Bradford. {{sic|Clarkes|nolink=yes}} Trans. Shipley.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

This letter was marked "Priority No 1". An index card was created on the basis of the letter and a policewoman found Sutcliffe already had three existing index cards in the records. But "for some inexplicable reason", said the Byford Report, the papers remained in a filing tray in the incident room until the murderer's arrest on 2 January the following year.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;

Birdsall visited Bradford Police Station the day after sending the letter to repeat his misgivings about Sutcliffe. He added that he was with Sutcliffe when he got out of a car to pursue a woman with whom he had had a bar room dispute in Halifax on 16 August 1975. This was the date and place of the Olive Smelt attack. A report compiled on the visit was lost, despite a "comprehensive search" which took place after Sutcliffe's arrest, according to the report.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt; Byford said:

{{quote|The failure to take advantage of Birdsall's anonymous letter and his visit to the police station was yet again a stark illustration of the progressive decline in the overall efficiency of the major incident room. It resulted in Sutcliffe being at liberty for more than a month when he might conceivably have been in custody. Thankfully, there is no reason to think he committed any further murderous assaults within that period.&lt;ref name="home office"/&gt;}}

==Custody==
===Prison and Broadmoor Hospital===
Following his conviction and incarceration, Sutcliffe chose to use the name Coonan, his mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg==|title=74 Adjudication|work=News &amp; Features|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|date=29 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207144321/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDQ0Mg%3D%3D|archivedate=7 December 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his sentence at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|HMP Parkhurst]] on 22 May 1981. Despite being found sane at his trial, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Attempts to send him to a secure psychiatric unit were blocked. While at Parkhurst he was seriously assaulted by James Costello, a 35-year-old career criminal with several convictions for violence. On 10 January 1983, he followed Sutcliffe into the recess of F2, the hospital wing at Parkhurst Prison, and plunged a broken coffee jar twice into the left side of Sutcliffe's face, creating four wounds requiring 30 stitches.&lt;ref name="Brannen"&gt;[http://www.execulink.com/~kbrannen/attackps.htm "Attacks on Peter Sutcliffe"], ''The Yorkshire Ripper''.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1984 Sutcliffe was sent to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], under Section 47 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/peter-sutcliffe-yorkshire-ripper-moved-from-broadmoor-psychiatric-hospital-to-prison-a7210211.html|title=Yorkshire Ripper moved back to prison after 32 years in Broadmoor|date=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife obtained a separation from him in 1982 and a divorce in April 1994. On 23 February 1996, Sutcliffe was attacked in his room in Broadmoor Hospital's Henley Ward. Paul Wilson, a convicted robber, asked to borrow a videotape before attempting to strangle him with the cable from a pair of stereo headphones. Two other convicted murderers, [[Kenneth Erskine]] and Jamie Devitt, intervened on hearing screams.&lt;ref name="Brannen"/&gt;

After an attack with a pen by fellow inmate Ian Kay on 10 March 1997, Sutcliffe lost the vision in his left eye, and his right eye was severely damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|title= Crime Case Closed: Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127141209/http://www.bbc.co.uk/crime/caseclosed/yorkshireripper1.shtml|archivedate=27 January 2007|work=BBC News|date=27 January 2007|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay admitted trying to kill Sutcliffe, and was ordered to be detained in a secure mental hospital without limit of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anon|title=Deranged killer admits Yorkshire Ripper blinding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/51090.stm|accessdate=6 January 2018|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 it was reported that Sutcliffe had developed diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/archive/2003/08/30/Bradford+District+Archive/8010330.Ripper_Sutcliffe_has_diabetes/ "Ripper Sutcliffe has diabetes"], ''Craven Herald and Pioneer'', 30 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutcliffe's father died in 2004 and was cremated. On 17 January 2005 Sutcliffe was allowed to visit [[Grange-over-Sands]] where the ashes had been scattered. The decision to allow the temporary release was initiated by [[David Blunkett]] and ratified by [[Charles Clarke]] when he became Home Secretary. Sutcliffe was accompanied by four members of the hospital staff. Despite the passage of 25 years since the Ripper murders, Sutcliffe's visit was the focus of front-page tabloid headlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4190525.stm "Ripper visits father's ashes site"], ''BBC News Online''. 20 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, Sutcliffe was attacked by fellow inmate Patrick Sureda, who lunged at him with a metal cutlery knife while shouting "You fucking raping, murdering bastard, I'll blind your fucking other one". Sutcliffe flung himself backwards and the blade missed his right eye, stabbing him in the cheek.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/24/ukcrime1 "Yorkshire Ripper stabbed in face"], ''The Guardian'', 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2009, it was reported&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4684906/Yorkshire-Ripper-Peter-Sutcliffe-fit-to-be-freed-from-Broadmoor.html "Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe 'fit to be freed from Broadmoor'."] ''Daily Telegraph''. 17 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that Sutcliffe was "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Jack Straw]], was questioned by [[Julie Kirkbride]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[Bromsgrove]], in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, "that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests to me that there are no circumstances in which this man will be released".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/8583782.stm|title='No release' for Yorkshire Ripper, says Jack Straw|work=BBC News|date=23 March 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 Sutcliffe told other prisoners one of his testicles was five times its normal size following treatment for a bladder infection. Subsequently a cancer scan was carried out with Sutcliffe then calling the [[National Health Service]] 'useless' for not giving him the results of his cancer scan immediately.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

==Legacy==
On 26 August 2016 the police investigation was the subject of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[The Reunion (radio programme)|The Reunion]]''. [[Sue MacGregor]] discussed the investigation with John Domaille, who later became assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police; Andy Laptew, who was a junior detective who interviewed Sutcliffe; Elaine Benson, who worked in the incident room and interviewed suspects; David Zackrisson, who investigated the "Wearside Jack" tape and letters in Sunderland and [[Christa Ackroyd]], a local journalist in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pdd7r|title=The Yorkshire Ripper Investigation, The Reunion – BBC Radio 4|work=bbc.co.uk|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Painthall&lt;!--This correct; it is NOT Paintball!--&gt; to determine if Sutcliffe was guilty of unsolved crimes dating back to 1964. This inquiry also looked at the killings of two sex workers in southern Sweden in 1980. As Sutcliffe was a lorry driver, it was theorised that he had been in Denmark and Sweden, making use of the ferry across the [[Oresund Strait]]. West Yorkshire Police later stated that they were "absolutely certain" that Sutcliffe had never been in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Joan|title=The Yorkshire Ripper was not a 'prostitute killer' – now his forgotten victims need justice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/yorkshire-ripper-not-prostitute-killer-forgotten-victims-need/|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=The Telegraph|date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Joanna Jolly | last = Jolly | first = Joanna | title = The Ripper and the Swedish murders | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/the_ripper_and_the_swedish_murders | accessdate = 13 January 2018 | work = BBC News | date = 12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
''[[This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper]]'', a British [[television]] [[crime drama]] miniseries, first shown on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 26 January to 2 February 2000 is a dramatisation of the real-life investigation into the murders, showing the effect that it had on the health and career of Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield ([[Alun Armstrong]]). The series also starred [[Richard Ridings]] and [[James Laurenson]] as DSI Dick Holland and Chief Constable Ronald Gregory, respectively. Although broadcast over two weeks, two episodes were shown consecutively each week. The series was nominated for the [[BAFTA|British Academy Television Award]] for Best Drama Serial at the 2001 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233115/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper Awards|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was released on DVD on 7 January 2013.

A three part series of one hour episodes, ''The Yorkshire Ripper Files: A Very British Crime Story'' aired on [[BBC Four]] in March 2019. This included interviews with some of the victims, their family, police and journalists who covered the case by film-maker Liza Williams. In the series she questions whether the attitude of both the police and society towards women prevented Sutcliffe from being caught sooner.

A play written by Olivia Hirst and [[David Byrne (playwright)|David Byrne]], ''The Incident Room'', premiered at Pleasance as part of the 2019 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. The play focuses on the police force hunting the Yorkshire Ripper. The play was produced by [[New Diorama Theatre|New Diorama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/05/the-incident-room-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019|title=The Incident Room review – Yorkshire Ripper retelling puts police in the spotlight|last=Love|first=Catherine|date=2019-08-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Thomas Straffen''' (27 February 1930 – 19 November 2007) was an [[England|English]] [[serial killer]] who was the longest-serving prisoner in British legal history. Straffen killed two young girls in the summer of 1951. He was found to be [[unfit to plead]] and committed to [[Broadmoor Hospital]]; during a brief escape in 1952, he killed again. This time, Straffen was convicted of [[murder]] and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Reprieved because of his mental state, Straffen had his sentence [[clemency|commuted]] to [[life imprisonment]], and he remained in prison until his death more than 55&amp;nbsp;years later.

==Early life==
John Straffen's father, John Straffen Sr, was a soldier in the [[British Army]]. The younger Straffen was the third child in the family; his older sister was regarded as a "[[Intellectual_disability#Terminology|high grade mental defective]]" who died in 1952.&lt;ref name="fairfield2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen was born at [[Bordon and Longmoor Military Camps|Bordon Camp]] in [[Hampshire]] where his father was then based. When Straffen was two years old, his father was posted abroad, and the family spent six years in [[British Raj|India]]. Returning to Britain in March 1938, Straffen's father took a discharge from the Army, and the family settled in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="fairfield2" /&gt;

In October 1938, Straffen was referred to a child guidance clinic for stealing and [[truancy]]. In June 1939, he first came before a juvenile court for stealing a purse from a girl and was given two years [[probation]]. His probation officer found that Straffen did not understand the difference between right and wrong, or the meaning of probation.&lt;ref name="fairfield2" /&gt; The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his [[Intelligence Quotient|I.Q.]] as 58 and placed his mental age at six. From June 1940, the local council sent him to a residential school for mentally defective children, St Joseph's School in [[Sambourne]].&lt;ref name="fairfield4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Straffen moved to Besford Court, a senior school. He was noted as a solitary boy who took correction very badly. At 14 he was suspected of strangling two [[goose|geese]].&lt;ref name="fairfield4" /&gt; At the age of 16, the school authorities undertook a review which found his I.Q. was 64 and his mental age was nine years six months, recommending his discharge.&lt;ref name="fairfield5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal career==
Straffen returned home to Bath in March 1946, where the [[Medical Officer of Health]] examined him and found he still warranted certification under the Mental Deficiency Act. After several short-term jobs, he found a place as a [[machinist]] in a clothing factory. Early in 1947, Straffen began to go into unoccupied homes and steal small items to hide them; he never took them home or gave the items to others. Straffen had no friends and began stealing without being enticed by others.&lt;ref name="fairfield5" /&gt;

On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl reported to police that a boy called John had [[assault]]ed her by putting his hand over her mouth and saying, "What would you do if I killed you? I have done it before." This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for [[burglary]] and, in his police interview, cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed in custody and the Medical Officer of [[Bristol (HM Prison)|Horfield prison]] examined him, certifying that he was [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]]. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in [[Bristol]] under the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.higgypop.com/urbex/hortham-hospital/&lt;/ref&gt;

Hortham was an "open" colony which specialised in training mentally disabled offenders for resettlement in the community. As he had been under investigation for burglary, Straffen's certificate stated that he was "not of violent or dangerous propensities." He was well-behaved at Hortham and kept away from other inmates. As a result, in July 1949, he was transferred to a lower-security agricultural [[hostel]] in [[Winchester]]. There he did well initially, but fell back into old ways when he stole a bag of walnuts and was sent back to Hortham in February 1950. In August 1950, Straffen got in trouble with Hortham authorities when he went home without leave and resisted the police when they went to recapture him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
In 1951, Straffen was examined at a Bristol hospital, where [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] readings showed that he had suffered "wide and severe damage to the [[cerebral cortex]], probably from an attack of [[encephalitis]] in India before the age of six." By now, however, Straffen was considered sufficiently rehabilitated to be allowed a period of unescorted home leave. He used the time to get a job at a [[Market gardening|market garden]], which he was allowed to keep. Hortham licensed him to the care of his mother, as the family home was less overcrowded. When Straffen's 21st birthday came, under the Mental Deficiency Act, he had to be reassessed by Hortham, which continued his certificate for a further five years; the family disputed the assessment and appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Medical Officer of Health for Bath examined Straffen again on 10 July 1951 and found improvement in mental age to 10; he recommended that Straffen's certificate be renewed only for six months with a view to discharge at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child killings==
According to Letitia Fairfield in the introduction to the ''Notable British Trials'' series volume about Straffen, he had a "smouldering hatred" and an "intense resentment" of the police and blamed them for all his troubles from the age of eight. On the morning of Straffen's assessment, a young girl named Christine Butcher was murdered. Fairfield speculates that Straffen saw the press coverage that followed and made the connection that strangling young girls gave the maximum amount of trouble to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July 1951, Straffen went to the cinema, on his own. His route took him past 1 [[Camden Crescent, Bath|Camden Crescent]] in Bath, where 5-year-old Brenda Goddard lived with her [[foster parent]]s. According to Straffen's later statement to the police, he saw Brenda gathering flowers and offered to show her a better place. He lifted Brenda over a fence into a [[coppicing|copse]], after which she fell and hit her head on a stone. She was unconscious, and he strangled her. Straffen did not make any attempt to hide the body and simply went on to the cinema, viewed the film ''[[Shockproof]]'', and returned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bath police had not previously suspected Straffen was violent, he was considered a suspect in the murder and seen by police on 3 August.&lt;ref name="Goddard suspicion"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 124 (Evidence of Thomas James Coles).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the police had visited his employer to check on his movements; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July.&lt;ref name="Sacked"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with a prison psychiatrist, Straffen said that he knew he was under suspicion and wanted to annoy the police, because he hated them for shadowing him.&lt;ref name="Police hatred"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 168-169 (Evidence of Dr Alexander Leitch).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August, Straffen was again at the cinema when he met 9-year-old Cicely Batstone. He first took Cicely to a different cinema to see another film and then went on the bus to a meadow known as "Tumps" on the outskirts of Bath. There he strangled her to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of the murder left many witnesses who had seen Straffen with the girl. The bus conductor recognised Straffen as a former workmate, a courting couple in the meadow had seen Straffen very closely, and a policeman's wife had also seen the two together. She mentioned it to her husband; when the alarm was raised the next morning, she guided police to where she had seen the two, and Cicely's body was discovered. Her description of the man was enough to identify Straffen immediately as the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and conviction==
Accordingly, the police drove to Straffen's home and arrested him for the murder of Cicely on the morning of 9 August. Straffen made a statement admitting he had killed Cicely and also confessed to the murder of Brenda: "The other girl, I did her the same."&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, C.B.E., M.D., and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 132-133 (Evidence of Albert Foster; statement of John Thomas Straffen).&lt;/ref&gt; He was duly charged with murder and remanded in custody.&lt;ref name="Murder charge"&gt;"Man Charged With Girl's Murder", ''The Times'', 11 August 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August, after a two-day hearing at [[Magistrates' Court|Bath Magistrates' Court]], Straffen was committed for trial for the murder of Brenda.&lt;ref name="Committed for trial"&gt;"Alleged Murder Of Two Girls", ''The Times'', 1 September 1951, p. 3. English law at the time did not permit an indictment for more than a single charge of murder.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Taunton]] [[Assize Court]], on 17 October 1951, Straffen stood trial for murder before Mr Justice Oliver. However, the only witness to be heard was Dr Peter Parkes, medical officer at Horfield Prison, who testified to Straffen's medical history and stated his conclusion that Straffen was [[unfit to plead]]. Oliver commented, "In this country we do not try people who are [[insanity|insane]]. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried." The jury formally returned a verdict that Straffen was insane and unfit to plead.&lt;ref name="Unfit to plead"&gt;"Labourer Found Unfit To Plead", ''The Times'', 18 October 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen was removed to [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor hospital]] in [[Berkshire]]. Broadmoor had originally been termed a criminal lunatic asylum, but by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]], responsibility for it had been transferred to the Ministry of Health, and those committed to it had been renamed patients.&lt;ref name="Broadmoor Enquiry report"&gt;"Report of the Broadmoor Enquiry Committee" (Cmd 8594), paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside Broadmoor, Straffen was given a job as a cleaner.

==Escape from Broadmoor and murder of Linda Bowyer==
On 29 April 1952, Straffen went with an attendant and another patient to clean some outbuildings that were close to the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 20 minutes after escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in [[Crowthorne]] and approached Mrs. Doris Spencer, who was in her garden. He asked her for a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor and the likelihood of escapes. After ten minutes, he left.&lt;ref name="Mrs Spencer"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 90 (Evidence of Mrs Doris Evelyn Spencer).&lt;/ref&gt; An hour and a half later, he reached [[Farley Hill, Berkshire|Farley Hill]], and at about five o'clock, Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Within half an hour, Bowyer was dead.&lt;ref name="Bowyer murder"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen then begged a cup of tea from another householder, Mrs Kenyon, who agreed to drive him to a bus stop. As they were drawing up to the stop, Straffen saw some men in uniform and asked whether they were police; on learning that they were, he swiftly got out of the car and ran away. Kenyon told the men (who were actually Broadmoor nurses) of the suspicious behaviour of her passenger, and Straffen was recaptured a few minutes later. Driven in the car on the journey back to Broadmoor, Straffen said, "I have finished with crime." The body of Linda was found at dawn the next day.&lt;ref name="Broadmoor Escape"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police went to Broadmoor to interview Straffen at 8am, arriving before news of the disappearance and murder of a local child had reached the hospital. The police went to Straffen's room and woke him up, then asking him what he had done when he was free and whether he had got into mischief. Straffen replied, "I did not kill her." The police inspector told Straffen that no-one had suggested anyone had been killed, and Straffen said: "I know what you policemen are, I know I killed two little children but I did not kill the little girl." The inspector then confirmed that a girl had been killed near where Straffen was recaptured. Straffen said, "I did not kill the little girl on the bicycle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straffen then made a long statement, which the police checked. On 1 May, Straffen was charged with the murder of Linda, and he appeared at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] County Magistrates' Court the following day. He was remanded in custody, and despite the fact of the order committing him to Broadmoor, the magistrates decided that, since they had failed to hold him, he should be remanded to [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health called for a full inquiry into how Straffen had escaped.&lt;ref name="Escape inquiry"&gt;"Inquiry Into Escape From Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 1 May 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of local residents held a meeting on the same evening as Straffen's court appearance to call for some system of public warning of an escape.&lt;ref name="Protest meeting"&gt;"Protest Meeting Near Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 3 May 1952, p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health inquiry was extended to a full independent inquiry.&lt;ref name="Inquiry extended"&gt;"Further Inquiry On Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 7 May 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broadmoor Sirens|A system of warning sirens]] was set up later in 1952 as a result of the inquiry recommendations.&lt;ref name="Warning system"&gt;"Security Measures At Broadmoor", ''The Times'', 17 October 1952, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bowyer murder trial==
When Straffen's murder trial opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted to leave the question of his sanity as an issue to be determined by the jury. After the prosecution case (led by the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]], Sir [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Reginald Manningham-Buller]]) had opened and called the first witnesses to establish the facts about the murder of Linda, they applied to call additional evidence about the two murders in Bath. This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|pp= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day, the judge was late into court and explained that "owing to the alleged conduct of one of your members," he was compelled to discharge them and start again with a new jury. It turned out that one of the first set of jurors had gone to a political club in [[Southsea]] in the evening and told those present that he was on the jury for the Straffen case, that Straffen was not guilty, and that one of the prosecution witnesses had murdered Linda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fairfield|Fullbrook|1954|p= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge required the errant juror, William Gladwin, to remain in court throughout the trial, before calling him to apologise for his "wicked discharge of your duties as a citizen".&lt;ref name="William Gladwin"&gt;"Straffen Guilty Of Murder", ''The Times'', 26 July 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first day's proceedings were repeated before the second jury, followed, as permitted, by evidence of what had happened in Bath. Straffen's defence called several of those who had seen Straffen in earlier years to give evidence of his mental condition. The prosecution then called prison medical officers and psychiatrists to give evidence in rebuttal. Dr. Thomas Munro, who was a specialist in mental deficiency and had seen Straffen, testified that he had said that to murder was wrong because it was breaking the law and because "it is one of the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]]". When Munro asked Straffen to name the other commandments, Straffen could remember only four.&lt;ref name="Commandments"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 204-205 (Evidence of Dr Thomas Arthur Howard Munro).&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring for just under an hour, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty, which implicitly declared Straffen sane. Mr Justice Cassels sentenced Straffen to [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death]].&lt;ref name="Verdict and sentence"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen [[appeal]]ed, on the grounds that the evidence about the Bath murders was wrongly admitted, and that his statements on the morning after the murder of Linda Bowyer were wrongly admitted because they had been made before he was cautioned. Both grounds of the appeal were dismissed,&lt;ref name="Appeal"&gt;"The Trial of John Thomas Straffen", edited by Letitia Fairfield, CBE, MD, and Eric P. Fullbrook (William Hodge, 1954), p. 264-273.&lt;/ref&gt; and Straffen was refused leave to appeal to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="No Lords appeal"&gt;"Straffen Refused House of Lords Appeal", ''The Times'', 27 August 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 4 September was fixed as the date for execution of judgment of death.&lt;ref name="Execution fixed"&gt;''The Times'', 28 August 1952, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 29 August, it was announced that [[Home Secretary]] [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]] had recommended to [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] that Straffen be reprieved.&lt;ref name="Reprieve"&gt;"Reprieve Recommended for Straffen", ''The Times'', 30 August 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprieve and prison==
After his reprieve, Straffen was moved to [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]]. In November 1952, the Home Office denied a rumour that he was about to be moved to the [[Rampton Secure Hospital|Rampton]] mental institution.&lt;ref name="No Rampton move"&gt;"Straffen 'Unlikely to be Moved'", ''The Times'', 3 November 1952, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Straffen was moved to Horfield Prison after officers discovered an escape attempt by Wandsworth prisoners who intended to take Straffen with them as a diversion.&lt;ref name="Horfield move"&gt;"Parliament", ''The Times'', 20 April 1956, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The news caused extreme concern in Bristol, and a petition demanding his removal was organised by a local councillor and signed by 12,000 people within weeks.&lt;ref name="Horfield transfer"&gt;"Film Protests On Straffen Denied", ''The Times'', 25 May 1956, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Horfield, Straffen was described by former politician [[Peter Baker (British politician)|Peter Baker]], briefly a fellow prisoner, as always being conspicuous when he was exercising, being much taller than anyone else and wearing distinctive clothing for a special watch prisoner. Baker thought the "long, emaciated, miserable figure" looked "like a dying butterfly or a caged animal" and reported rumours that Straffen made application to the governor every month to see if a date had been set for his release.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Baker, "Time Out of Life", Heinemann, 1961, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1958, Straffen was moved to [[Cardiff (HM Prison)|Cardiff Prison]] when the regime at Horfield was changed to a more liberal one.&lt;ref name="Cardiff transfer"&gt;"Straffen Transferred", ''The Times'', 25 August 1958, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was reported to have been transferred back in June 1960.&lt;ref name="Back to Horfield"&gt;"Straffen Transferred Report", ''The Times'', 7 June 1960, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new 28-cell high-security wing at [[Parkhurst (HM Prison)|Parkhurst Prison]] was built and ready for opening early in 1966. The Home Office pointedly did not deny rumours that Straffen had been secretly transferred there on 31 January 1966.&lt;ref name="Parkhurst move"&gt;"Straffen Transferred?", ''The Times'', 2 February 1966, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to arrive, and was followed by six of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train robbers]].&lt;ref name="Parkhurst companions"&gt;"Train Robbers Have A Car Each In Transfer", ''The Times'', 5 February 1966, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1968, Straffen was moved to [[Durham (HM Prison)|Durham Prison]].&lt;ref name="Durham move"&gt;"Straffen moved", ''The Times'', 23 May 1968, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Placed in the top security E wing, Straffen was joined by fellow child killer [[Ian Brady]]. Crime author Jonathan Goodman wrote that "the shambling lunatic [Straffen] .. is in prison only because no mental institution is secure enough to guarantee his confinement".&lt;ref name="Jonathan Goodman"&gt;"The Trial of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley", ed. by Jonathan Goodman (Celebrated Trials Series, David &amp; Charles, 1973), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, a prison officer recalled seeing Straffen "circling, banging the fence every couple of minutes", and that one fellow officer described him as aloof and hostile: "Never talks unless he has to ask for something. Always on his own".&lt;ref name="Life in Durham"&gt;Mitya Underwood, "Lifting the lid on my prison life", ''Evening Chronicle'', 6 August 2007, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Straffen was still at Durham Prison in January 1984 when Kenneth Barlow was released after serving 26 years for murder, at which point he became the longest serving British prisoner.&lt;ref name="Longest serving"&gt;"Man to be freed after 26 years", ''The Times'', 31 December 1983, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentencing terms===
For most of the time that Straffen was in prison, the Home Secretary had to agree to the release of any life sentence prisoner; no occupant of the office was ever willing to let Straffen out. In 1994, [[Michael Howard]] decided to compile a select list of about 20 prisoners serving life sentences who must never be released, and Straffen's name was said to be on it.&lt;ref name="No release"&gt;''Sunday Telegraph'', 3 April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole list was published by the ''[[News of the World]]'' in December 1997; this report confirmed that Straffen would indeed spend the rest of his life in prison.

In 2001, with the 50th anniversary of Straffen's imprisonment approaching, his solicitors called for his case to be reopened on the grounds that he had not been fit to stand trial.&lt;ref name="Reopen case"&gt;"Killer jail review", ''Birmingham Mail'', 26 May 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Bob Woffinden]], who examined previously confidential records, uncovered that Straffen had been reprieved after a majority of doctors who examined him found that he was insane.&lt;ref name="Insane at trial"&gt;Bob Woffinden, "Historic murder case may reopen: Uncovered records could liberate UK's longest serving prisoner", ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2001, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Woffinden also doubted Straffen's guilt in the murder of Linda, because Straffen had no fingernails with which to cause injuries seen on her body and because some local witnesses placed the time of the murder after his recapture.&lt;ref name="Guilt doubts"&gt;Bob Woffinden, "Insane, guilty or neither?", ''The Guardian'' Weekend Section, 26 May 2001, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straffen's application to the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] was turned down in December 2002.&lt;ref name="CCRC refused"&gt;"Child-Killer To Die In Prison", ''Western Daily Press'', 3 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] decided a case brought by a life sentence prisoner which challenged the authority of the Home Secretary to refuse to release him after the [[Parole Board]] recommended he be freed. The court decided that politicians should not interfere in life sentences and therefore current practice was unlawful. It was immediately noted that this meant an opportunity for release for Straffen,&lt;ref name="ECHR judgment"&gt;Dan McDougall, Arthur MacMillan, "Human Rights court rules government must not interfere in life sentences", ''Scotsman'', 29 May 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; who had been in [[Long Lartin (HM Prison)|Long Lartin Prison]] since 2000.

==Death==
Straffen died at [[Frankland (HM Prison)|Frankland Prison]] in [[County Durham]] on 19 November 2007 at the age of 77. He had been in prison for a British record of 55&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,,2213663,00.html|title=Longest-serving UK prisoner dies, aged 77 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Allegra | last=Stratton | date=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Brady]], who had been in prison since October 1965 and was then in [[Ashworth Hospital]], became Britain's longest-serving prisoner until his own death ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;Yakub Qureshi, "Final farewell for Moors murder victim Keith Bennett", ''Manchester Evening News'', 4 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="4602" xml:space="preserve">'''Rebecca Smith''' (née '''Prior'''; [[Baptism|chr.]] 17 May 1807 – 23 August 1849) was the last British woman to be executed for the [[infanticide]] of her own child. She was convicted of killing her infant son Richard, and was publicly [[hanged]] at [[Devizes]], [[Wiltshire]]. After her trial she confessed to having poisoned seven of her other children.

==Early life==
Smith was born in the village of [[Bratton, Wiltshire]], the daughter of William and Sarah Prior (or Pryor). Her father, who died in 1830, was a successful [[yeoman farmer]], while her mother was a prominent member of the local [[Particular Baptist]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Katherine D.|last1=Watson|date=November 2008|title=Religion, Community and the Infanticidal Mother: Evidence from 1840s Rural Wiltshire|url=https://www.academia.edu/9671973/Religion_Community_and_the_Infanticidal_Mother_Evidence_from_1840s_Rural_Wiltshire|journal=Family &amp; Community History|volume=11|issue=2|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1831, she married an agricultural labourer, Philip Smith, who had a reputation as a drunkard. Their first child, Jane, was born the following year. Ten others followed, none of which lived more than a few months. In 1846, following her mother's death, Smith inherited £100 and moved the family to [[Westbury, Wiltshire|Westbury]].&lt;ref name=p120&gt;Watson (2008), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband squandered the inheritance, and she was forced to find seasonal work as a crop-picker and vegetable grower, and living in "a visible state of poverty and ill health".&lt;ref name=p121&gt;Watson (2008), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Smith's eleventh child, Richard, was born on 16 May 1849. He was initially healthy, but was taken ill on 7 June and died on the morning of 12 June. The local registrar, George Shorland, initially recorded the cause of death as unknown, but was persuaded by local rumours to order an inquest.&lt;ref name=p121/&gt; Richard's body was exhumed on 22 June and autopsied on 24 June, where traces of arsenic were discovered in his stomach. Smith's neighbours claimed that she had made a series of attempts to purchase poison both before and after the birth, culminating in a purchase of "[[Arsenic trioxide|white arsenic]]" on the morning of 7 June. Inquests into the deaths of two more of her children (Sarah and Edward) were conducted on 18 July, and both their bodies were also found to contain arsenic.&lt;ref name=p122&gt;Watson (2008), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Smith was put on trial for Richard's death on 9 August 1849, at the [[Assizes|court of assize]] in [[Devizes]]. Eighteen witnesses were called, many of whom testified about her attempts to buy poison and false statements she had made about her son's health.&lt;ref name=p122/&gt; The jury took 30 minutes to find her guilty, but also issued a recommendation of mercy; the judge ignored this and sentenced her to death.&lt;ref name=p123&gt;Watson (2008), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the trial, Smith made a confession to the prison chaplain in which she admitted using rat poison to kill seven of her other children.&lt;ref name=p124&gt;Watson (2008), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Of her eleven children, only the first-born survived to adulthood – two died of natural causes, and the other eight were killed.&lt;ref name=p120/&gt;

Smith was publicly hanged in Devizes on 23 August, despite two petitions for mercy being sent to the [[Home Secretary]].&lt;ref name=p123/&gt; The press and general public were heavily in favour of her execution, despite infanticide usually being viewed as less repellent than standard murder and thus less deserving of capital punishment. Factors that were atypical (and thus weighed against her) included the premeditated nature of the act and its apparent brutality – poisoning was considered much more cruel than the more common methods of drowning or smothering.&lt;ref name=p124/&gt; As an older married woman, she was also viewed with less sympathy than younger women who gave birth out of wedlock and killed their babies to avoid social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (2008), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Joseph Smith''' (11 January 1872 – 13 August 1915) was an [[English people|English]] [[serial killer]] and [[bigamy|bigamist]]. In 1915, he was [[criminal conviction|convicted]] and subsequently [[hanging|hanged]] for the murders of three women, the case becoming known as the '''Brides in the Bath Murders'''. As well as being widely reported in the media, the case was significant in the history of [[forensic pathology]] and detection. It was also one of the first cases in which similarities between connected crimes were used to prove deliberation, a technique used in subsequent [[prosecution]]s.

== Early life and marriages ==
The son of an insurance agent, George Joseph Smith was born in [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]]. He was sent to a [[reformatory]] at [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], at the age of nine and later served time for [[Fraud|swindling]] and [[theft]]. In 1896, he was imprisoned for twelve months for persuading a woman to steal from her employers. He used the proceeds to open a baker's shop in [[Leicester]].

In 1898, under the [[Pseudonym|alias]] Oliver George Love, Smith married Caroline Beatrice Thornhill in Leicester; it was his only legal marriage (although he also married another woman [[bigamy|bigamously]] the following year). They moved to London, where she worked as a maid for a number of employers, stealing from them for her husband. She was eventually caught in [[Worthing]], [[Sussex]], and sentenced to twelve months. On her release, she incriminated her husband, and he was imprisoned in January 1901 for two years. On his release, she fled to [[Canada]]. Smith then went back to his other wife, cleared out her savings, and left.

In June 1908, Smith married Florence Wilson, a widow from Worthing. On 3 July, he left her, but not before taking [[Pound sterling|£]]30 ({{Inflation|UK|30|1908|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) drawn from her [[savings account]] and selling her belongings from their [[Camden Town|Camden]] residence in London. On 30 July, in [[Bristol]], Smith married Edith Peglar, who had replied to an advertisement for a [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]]. He would disappear for months at a time, saying that he was going to another city to ply his trade, which he claimed was selling [[antique]]s. In between his other marriages, Smith would always come back to Peglar with money.

In October 1909, Smith married Sarah Freeman, under the name George Rose Smith. As with Wilson, he left her after clearing out her savings and selling her [[war bond]]s, with a total take of £400. He then married Bessie Mundy and Alice Burnham. In September 1914, he married Alice Reid, under the alias Charles Oliver James. In total, Smith entered into seven bigamous marriages between 1908 and 1914. In most of these cases, Smith went through his wives' possessions before he disappeared.

== Two similar deaths ==
In January 1915, Division [[Detective Inspector]] [[Arthur Neil]] received a letter from a Joseph Crossley, who owned a [[boarding house]] in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]]. Included with the letter were two newspaper clippings: one was from the ''[[News of the World]]'' dated before Christmas 1914, about the death of Margaret Elizabeth Lloyd (''née'' Lofty), aged 38, who died in her lodgings in 14 Bismarck Road, [[Highgate]], London (later renamed Waterlow Road). She was found in her bathtub by her husband, John Lloyd, and their [[landlady]].

The other clipping contained the report of a [[coroner]]'s [[inquest]] dated 13 December 1913, in Blackpool. It was about a woman named Alice Smith (''née'' Burnham), who died suddenly in a boarding house in that seaside resort while in her bathtub. She was found by her husband, George Smith. Alice was not an heiress but had worked hard and saved money. Additionally, Smith took out a [[life insurance]] policy on his wife worth £500 ({{Inflation|UK|500|1913|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).&lt;ref name="casebook"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brides in the Bath|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhw_o6ePWwA|accessdate=22 June 2017|work=Fred Dinenage: Murder Casebook|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, dated 3 January, was written by Crossley, the [[landlord]] of Mr and Mrs Smith, on behalf of Crossley's wife and a Mr. Charles Burnham, who both expressed their suspicion on the striking similarity of the two incidents and urged the police to investigate the matter.

== The hunt ==
On 17 December 1913, Neil went to 14 Bismarck Road, where the Lloyds had taken lodgings. He found it hard to believe that an adult like Mrs Lloyd could have drowned in such a small tub, especially since the tub was three-quarters full when she was found. He then interviewed the [[coroner]], a Dr. Bates, who had signed the [[death certificate]], and asked if there were signs of violence on the woman. There were none except for a tiny bruise above the left elbow.

Upon further investigation, Neil learned that a [[will (law)|will]] had been made on the 18th, three hours before Mrs Lloyd died, and the sole [[beneficiary]] was her husband who had submitted the will to a lawyer "for settlement". In addition, she had withdrawn all her savings on that same day.

On 12 January, Dr. Bates called Neil with an inquiry from the Yorkshire Insurance Company regarding the death of Mrs Lloyd. She had, three days before she was married, taken out a life insurance policy for £700 ({{Inflation|UK|700|1913|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), with her husband John as sole beneficiary. Neil promptly asked the doctor to delay his reply. At the same time, he requested more information on the Smith case from the Blackpool police. Similarly, the late Mrs Smith had earlier taken out a life insurance policy, and made a will in her husband's favour, and she took the lodgings in Blackpool only after Mr Smith inspected the bathtub.

Neil asked the coroner to issue a favourable report to the insurance company. He was counting on the suspect to get in touch with his lawyer, and the office was watched day and night. On 1 February, a man fitting Lloyd/Smith's description appeared. Neil introduced himself and asked him whether he was John Lloyd. After Lloyd answered in the affirmative, Neil then asked him whether he was also George Smith. The man denied it vehemently. Neil, already sure that Lloyd and Smith were the same man, told him that he would take him for questioning on suspicion of bigamy. The man finally admitted that he was indeed Smith, and was arrested.

== Spilsbury enters the case ==
When Smith was arrested for the charge of bigamy and suspicion of murder, the [[pathologist]] [[Bernard Spilsbury]] was asked to determine how the women died.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rose, ''Lethal Witness'', Sutton Publishing 2007, Kent State University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was the [[Home Office]] [[pathologist]] and acted mainly in a consulting capacity, he was also available for direct assistance to the police force.

Margaret Lloyd's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]], and Spilsbury's first task was to confirm [[drowning]] as the cause of death; and if so, whether by accident or by force. He confirmed the tiny bruise on the elbow as noted before, as well as two microscopic marks. Even the evidence of drowning was not extensive. There were no signs of [[heart disease|heart]] or [[circulatory disease]], but the evidence suggested that death was almost instantaneous, as if the victim died of a sudden [[stroke]]. Poison was also seen as a possibility, and Spilsbury ordered tests on its presence. Finally, he proposed to Neil that they run some experiments in the very same bathtub in which Mrs Lloyd died. Neil had it set up in the police station.

Newspaper reports about the "Brides in the Baths" began to appear. On 8 February, the [[chief police officer]] of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]], a small seaside resort in [[Kent]], had read the stories, and sent Neil a report of another death which was strikingly similar to the other two.

== A third victim ==
A year before Burnham's death in Blackpool, one Henry Williams had rented a house with no bath in 80 High Street, for himself and his wife, Beatrice "Bessie" Mundy, whom he had married in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Dorset]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=James |title=Murder by Numbers - Fascinating Figures Behind The World's Worst Crimes |publisher=History Press |location=2018 |isbn=9780750981453 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then rented a bathtub seven weeks later. He took his wife to a local [[General practitioner|GP]], Dr Frank French, due to an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] fit, although she was only complaining of headaches, for which the doctor prescribed some medication.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; On 12 July 1912, Williams woke French, saying that his wife was having another fit.[[File:GeorgeJosephSmithBridesintheBath1914BessieMundya.jpg|150px|thumb|George Joseph Smith and Bessie Mundy, pictured shortly before her murder]] He checked on her, and promised to come back the following afternoon. However, he was surprised when, on the following morning, he was informed by Williams that his wife had died of drowning. The doctor found Bessie in the tub, her head under water, her legs stretched out straight and her feet protruding out of the water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; There was no trace of violence, so French attributed the drowning to epilepsy. The inquest [[jury]] awarded Williams the amount of £2,579 13s 7d (£2,579.68p) ({{Inflation|UK|2579|1912|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), as stipulated in Mrs Williams' will, made up five days before her death.

Neil then sent photographs of Smith to Herne Bay for possible identification, and then went to Blackpool, where Spilsbury was conducting an [[autopsy]] of Alice Smith. The results were the same as with Margaret Lloyd: the lack of violence, every suggestion of instantaneous death, and little evidence of drowning. Furthermore, there were no traces of poison on Margaret Lloyd. Baffled, Spilsbury routinely took measurements of the corpse and had the tub sent to London.

Back in London, Neil had received confirmation from Herne Bay. "Henry Williams" was also "John Lloyd" and "George Smith". This time, when Spilsbury examined Bessie Williams, he found one sure sign of drowning: the presence of [[Goose bumps|goose pimples]] on the skin on her thigh. As with the other two deaths, the tub in which Mrs Williams had died was sent to London.

== Solution ==
For weeks, Spilsbury pondered over the bathtubs and the victims' measurements. The first stage of an epileptic fit consists of a stiffening and extension of the entire body. Considering Bessie Williams' height (5 feet, 7 inches) and the length of the tub (5 feet), the upper part of her body would have been pushed up the sloping head of the tub, far above the level of the water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; The second stage consists of violent spasms of the limbs, which were drawn up to the body and then flung outward. Therefore, no one of her size could possibly get under water, even when her muscles were relaxed, in the third stage: the tub was simply too small.

Using French's description of Bessie Williams when he found her in the bathtub, Spilsbury reasoned that Smith must have seized her by the feet and suddenly pulled them up toward himself, sliding the upper part of the body under water.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; The sudden flood of water into her nose and throat might cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and sudden loss of consciousness, explaining the absence of injuries and minimal signs of drowning.

Neil hired several experienced female divers of the same size and build as the victims. He tried to push them under water by force but there would be inevitable signs of struggle. Neil then unexpectedly pulled the feet of one of the divers, and her head glided underwater before she knew what happened. Suddenly Neil saw that the woman was no longer moving. He quickly pulled her out of the tub and it took him and a doctor over half an hour to revive her.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; When she came to, she related that the only thing she remembered was the rush of water before she lost consciousness. Thus was Spilsbury's theory confirmed.

George Joseph Smith was arrested 15 February 1915 and formally charged for the murders of Bessie Williams, Alice Smith and Margaret Lloyd on 23 March 1915.

== Trial and legal legacy ==
On 22 June, the trial began at the [[Old Bailey]]. The prosecuting counsel were [[Archibald Bodkin]] (later [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]), [[Cecil Whiteley]] (later [[Queen's Counsel|KC]]) and [[Travers Humphreys]] (later Mr Justice Humphreys).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Murder|last= Wilson|first= Colin|authorlink= |author2=Patricia Pitman |year= 1984|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 978-0-330-28300-7|pages= 577–580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Trial of George Joseph Smith|last= Watson|first= ER (Ed)|authorlink= |year= 1922|publisher= [[William Hodge]]|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he could only be tried for the murder of Bessie Mundy in accordance with [[English law]], the [[prosecution]] used the deaths of the other two to establish the pattern of Smith's crimes; this was allowed by [[Thomas Edward Scrutton|Mr Justice Scrutton]] despite the protests of Smith's [[barrister|counsel]], [[Edward Marshall Hall|Sir Edward Marshall Hall]]. Smith elected not to give evidence in his own defence, indicating this to Marshall Hall in a handwritten note (pictured).
[[File:Smith's instructions to counsel.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Smith's handwritten note to Marshall Hall]]

It took the jury about 20 minutes on 1 July to find him guilty; he was then [[death sentence|sentenced to death]]. Marshall Hall [[appeal]]ed on the grounds that the evidence of "system" has been improperly admitted, but [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Lord Reading LCJ]] dismissed the appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Famous cases: nine trials that changed the law | author1=Brian P. Block | author2=John Hostettler | publisher=Waterside Press| year=2002 | isbn=978-1-872870-34-2 | pages=225–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smith was hanged in [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Prison]] on 13 August by hangman [[John Ellis (executioner)|John Ellis]].

The use of 'system'—comparing other crimes to the one a criminal is being tried for to prove guilt—set a [[precedent]] that was later used in other murder trials. For example, the doctor and suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams]] was charged for the murder of [[Edith Alice Morrell]], but the deaths of [[Gertrude Hullett]] and her husband Jack were used in the committal hearing to prove the existence of a pattern. This use of 'system' was later criticised by the trial judge when Adams was tried only on the Morrell charge.&lt;ref&gt;Devlin, Patrick. Easing the passing: The trial of Doctor John Bodkin Adams, London, The Bodley Head, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Why Britain is at War]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Why Britain is at War" (1939) by Harold Nicolson, republished as {{ISBN|978-0-14-104896-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Nicolson]] used Smith's repeatedly murderous behaviour as a parallel to Hitler's repeatedly acquisitive behaviour in Europe in the 1930s.
In Evelyn Waugh's book ''[[Unconditional Surrender (novel)|Unconditional Surrender]]'', which is set during the Second World War, General Whale is referred to as "Brides-in-the-bath" because all the operations he sponsored seemed to require the extermination of all involved.

The Smith case is mentioned in Dorothy L. Sayers' mysteries ''[[Unnatural Death (novel)|Unnatural Death]]''&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L.

Sayers, ''[Busman's Honeymoon]'', Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as in Agatha Christie's ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' and ''[[The Murder on the Links]]''. It is also mentioned on Patricia Highsmith's novel ''[[A Suspension of Mercy]]'' at page 63: "Not for him the Smith brides-in-a-bath murders for peanuts." The crimes of George Joseph Smith also feature in William Trevor's novel ''[[The Children of Dynmouth]]'' in which the sociopathic protagonist plans to re-enact the crimes as part of the community's Easter Fete. On page 273 of Monica Ferris's novel "The Drowning Spool," it mentions "a certain George Joseph Smith" who is discovered through the work of "a very clever forensic investigator back then." [[Margery Allingham]]'s short story "Three Is a Lucky Number" (1955) adapts the events and refers to James Joseph Smith and his brides. The Smith case was dramatised on the radio series ''[[The Black Museum]]'' in 1952 under the title of ''The Bath Tub''. Czechoslovak Television's series ''Adventures of Criminology'' (1990), based on famous criminal cases in which new methods of investigation were used, depicts this case in the episode ''Reconstruction''. The protagonist of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1968 short story "[[An American Organ]]" wishes to emulate Smith by murdering his wife in a bath.

Smith is mentioned and features at [[Madame Tussauds]] museum in the 1969 [[Special Branch]] episode 'You Don't Exist'. A missing episode of ''[[Dead of Night (TV series)|Dead of Night]]'' (1972), a [[BBC2]] paranormal anthology series, entitled ''Smith'' concerned Smith's spirit possessing a man and re-enacting one of his murders. [[Silent Witness]] episode ''Fatal Error'' (2003) contains a reference to the case in connection with a series of murders based on forensic pathology textbook examples. There was also ''[[The Brides in the Bath]]'' (2003), a TV film made by [[Yorkshire Television]], starring [[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]] as George Smith and the play [[Tryst (drama)|''Tryst'']] by [[Karoline Leach]], first produced in New York in 2006, starring [[Maxwell Caulfield]] and [[Amelia Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wild-reality.net/tryst/ |title=TRYST |publisher=wild-reality.net |accessdate=2010-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This story is the basis for the play ''The Drowning Girls'' by Beth Graham, Charlie Tomlinson, Daniela Vlaskalic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/stage/2009/10/16/11420751-sun.html | journal=Toronto Sun | date=16 October 2009 | author=John Coulbourn | title=
Girls' tale slips slowly beneath the water }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Echoes of the Dead" from the British TV detective series ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[List_of_Midsomer_Murders_episodes#Series_14_(2011–12)|Midsomer Murders: Echoes of the Dead]]'', Series 14 (2011-12), Episode 3.&lt;/ref&gt; DCI Barnaby solves a series of murders that revolve around "Brides-in-the-bath" murders with multiple references to the case including Smith, Spilsbury and the forensic science of the period.

For some years, Smith's waxwork was exhibited in the [[Chamber of Horrors (Madame Tussauds)|Chamber of Horrors]] at [[Madame Tussauds]] in London.

The 1949 movie ''[[Obsession (1949 film)|Obsession]]'' mentions the brides in the bath case.

'''Harold Frederick Shipman''' (14 January 1946&amp;nbsp;– 13 January 2004), known to his family and friends as '''Fred Shipman''', was an [[English people|English]] [[general practitioner]] and is believed to be [[List of serial killers by number of victims|the most prolific serial killer in history]]. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of the murder of 15 patients under his care, with his total number of victims estimated to be around 250. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with the recommendation that he [[whole life tariff|never be released]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3391897.stm |title=Harold Shipman: The killer doctor|work= BBC News|date= 13 January 2004|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Shipman Inquiry]], a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by [[Janet Smith (judge)|Dame Janet Smith]], examined Shipman's crimes. The inquiry identified 215 victims and estimated his total victim count at 250, about 80% of whom were elderly women. Shipman's youngest confirmed victim was a 41-year-old man,&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |title=The Shipman Inquiry |publisher=The Shipman Inquiry |accessdate=4 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413134928/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |archivedate=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although "significant suspicion" arose that he had killed patients as young as four.&lt;ref name = "killed early"/&gt;

Much of the [[United Kingdom]]'s legal structure concerning [[health care]] and medicine was reviewed and modified as a result of Shipman's crimes. He is the only British doctor to have been found guilty of murdering his patients, although other doctors have been [[acquittal|acquitted]] of similar crimes or convicted on lesser charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Stovold |url=http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm |title=The Case of Dr. John Bodkin Adams |publisher=Strangerinblood.co.uk |date= |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman committed suicide on 13 January 2004, one day before his 58th birthday, by [[suicide by hanging|hanging himself]] in his cell at [[Wakefield Prison]].

==Early life and career==
Harold Frederick Shipman was born on the [[Bestwood Estate|Bestwood council estate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=Portrait of a necrophiliac|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/13/shipman.health|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nottingham]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]], the second of the three children of Harold Frederick Shipman (12 May 1914 – 5 January 1985), a lorry driver, and Vera Brittan (23 December 1919 – 21 June 1963).&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swan|first=Norman|title=Why Some Doctors Kill|pages=|publisher=The Health Report|date=29 July 2002|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/healthreport/stories/2002/636389.htm|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Robert M.|title=Medical Murder: Disturbing Cases of Doctors Who Kill|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2009|pages=59–60|isbn=978-1-74175-610-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His working-class parents were devout [[Methodism|Methodists]].&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"/&gt; When growing up, Shipman was an accomplished [[rugby football|rugby]] player in youth leagues.

Shipman passed his [[eleven-plus]] in 1957, moving to High Pavement Grammar School, Nottingham, which he left in 1964. He excelled as a distance runner, and in his final year at school served as vice-captain of the athletics team. Shipman was particularly close to his mother, who died of [[lung cancer]] when he was 17.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Born to Kill?]]'', [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bookref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbert|first=Ian|title=How a humble GP perverted his medical skill to become Britain's most prolific mass killer|date=14 January 2004|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-a-humble-gp-perverted-his-medical-skill-to-become-britains-most-prolific-mass-killer-573066.html|accessdate=2 September 2009|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death came in a manner similar to what later became Shipman's own ''[[modus operandi]]'': in the later stages of her disease, she had [[morphine]] administered at home by a doctor. Shipman witnessed his mother's pain subside, despite her terminal condition, until her death on 21 June 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/shipman/die_3.html] The Early Life of Harold Shipman&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 1966, Shipman married Primrose May Oxtoby. They had four children together.

Shipman studied medicine at [[Leeds School of Medicine]], graduating in 1970.&lt;ref name="bbc2002"/&gt; He began working at Pontefract General Infirmary in [[Pontefract]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], and in 1974 took his first position as a [[general practitioner]] (GP) at the Abraham Ormerod Medical Centre in [[Todmorden]]. In the following year, he was caught forging prescriptions of [[pethidine]] (Demerol) for his own use. He was fined £600, and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic in [[York]]. He became a GP at the Donneybrook Medical Centre in [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] near [[Manchester]], in 1977.&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harold Shipman: Timeline|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2136444.stm|accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bunyan|first=Nigel|title=The Killing Fields of Harold Shipman|pages=|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 June 2001|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724155/The-Killing-Fields-of-Harold-Shipman.html|accessdate=1 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s, and established his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993, becoming a respected member of the community. In 1983, he was interviewed in an edition of the [[Granada Television]] documentary ''[[World in Action]]'' on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/shipman/uncovering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022183541/http://www.tamesideadvertiser.co.uk/news/shipman/uncovering/ |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after his conviction, the interview was re-broadcast on ''[[Tonight with Trevor McDonald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1159420.stm |title=Shipman interview rebroadcast |work=BBC News |date=8 February 2001 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
In March 1998, Linda Reynolds of the Donneybrook Surgery in Hyde, prompted by Deborah Massey from Frank Massey and Sons funeral parlour, expressed concerns to John Pollard, the [[coroner]] for the South Manchester District, about the high death rate among Shipman's patients. In particular, she was concerned about the large number of [[cremation]] forms for elderly women that he had needed countersigned. The matter was brought to the attention of the police, who were unable to find sufficient evidence to bring charges; the Shipman Inquiry later blamed the police for assigning inexperienced officers to the case. Between 17 April 1998, when the police abandoned the investigation, and Shipman's eventual arrest, he killed three more people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/secondreport.asp|title=Second Report&amp;nbsp;— The Police Investigation of March 1998 (Cm 5853)|date=14 July 2003|publisher=The Shipman Inquiry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305085744/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/secondreport.asp|archivedate=5 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3064231.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman inquiry criticises police|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=30 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, Hyde taxi driver John Shaw contacted the police, informing them that he suspected Shipman of murdering twenty-one of his patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3152204.stm|title=I feel guilty over Shipman killings|date=30 September 2003|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman's last victim was Kathleen Grundy, who was found dead at her home on 24 June 1998. He was the last person to see her alive; he later signed her [[death certificate]], recording "old age" as the [[cause of death]]. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when [[solicitor]] Brian Burgess informed her that a [[will and testament|will]] had been made, apparently by her mother; there were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded Woodruff and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. At Burgess's urging, Woodruff went to the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed and when examined, was found to contain traces of [[diamorphine]] (heroin), often used for pain control in [[terminal cancer]] patients. Shipman claimed that she was an addict, and showed them comments he had written to that effect in his computerised medical journal; however, examination of his computer showed that they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a [[Brother Industries|Brother]] [[typewriter]] of the kind used to make the [[forgery|forged]] will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=The Shipman tapes I|date=31 January 2000|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/the_shipman_murders/the_shipman_files/613286.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police then investigated other deaths Shipman had certified, and created a list of fifteen specimen cases to investigate. They discovered a pattern of his administering lethal doses of diamorphine, signing patients' death certificates, and then falsifying medical records to indicate that they had been in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Doctor 'forged victim's medical history'|date=8 November 1999|publisher=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/510002.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|pages=|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prescription For Murder'', a 2000 book by journalists Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie, advanced two theories on Shipman's [[motive (law)|motive]] for forging the will: that he wanted to be caught because his life was out of control, or that he planned to retire at the age of 55 and leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, B and Richie, J. ''Prescription for Murder: The True Story of Dr. Harold Frederick Shipman''. Little Brown (2000), pp. 348–9. {{ISBN|0751529982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[David Spiegelhalter]] ''et al.'' suggested that "statistical monitoring could have led to an alarm being raised at the end of 1996, when there were 67 excess deaths in females aged over 65 years, compared with 119 by 1998."&lt;ref&gt;Spiegelhalter, D. ''et al.'' [http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/7.full.pdf Risk-adjusted sequential probability ratio tests: application to Bristol, Shipman and adult cardiac surgery.] ''Int J Qual Health Care'', vol. 15, pp. 7–13 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
Shipman's trial began at [[Preston Crown Court]] on 5 October 1999. He was charged with the murders of 15 women by lethal injections of [[Heroin|diamorphine]], all between 1995 and 1998.

His legal representatives tried unsuccessfully to have the Grundy case, where a clear motive was alleged, tried separately from the others where no motive was apparent.

On 31 January 2000, after six days of deliberation, the jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen counts of murder and one count of forgery. [[Thayne Forbes|Mr Justice Forbes]] subsequently sentenced Shipman to [[life imprisonment]] on all fifteen counts of murder, with a recommendation that he [[whole life tariff|never be released]], to be served concurrently with a sentence of four years for forging Grundy's will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/616692.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman jailed for 15 murders|date=31 January 2000|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 February 2000, ten days after his conviction, the [[General Medical Council]] formally struck Shipman off its register. Two years later, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] confirmed the judge's whole life tariff, just months before British government ministers [[Anthony Anderson (murderer)|lost their power]] to set minimum terms for prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/gmc-strikes-shipman-off-medical-register-725618.html|work=The Independent|title=GMC strikes Shipman off medical register|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010|location=London|first1=Maxine|last1=Frith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/638291.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman struck off|date=11 February 2000|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While authorities could have brought many additional charges, they concluded that a fair hearing would be impossible in view of the enormous publicity surrounding the original trial. Furthermore, the fifteen life sentences already handed down rendered further litigation unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 ''[[The Shipman Inquiry]]''&amp;nbsp;— Sixth Report&amp;nbsp;— Conclusions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413134928/http://www.the-shipman-inquiry.org.uk/6r_page.asp?ID=3401 |date=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4212627.stm|title=Shipman's 'reckless' experiments|date=27 January 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman consistently denied his guilt, disputing the scientific evidence against him. He never made any public statements about his actions. Shipman's wife, Primrose, steadfastly maintained her husband's innocence, even after his conviction.&lt;ref name="Sweet2004"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/16/gender.uk|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=He could do no wrong|date=16 January 2004|accessdate=4 May 2010|first=Corinne|last=Sweet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipman is the only doctor in the history of British medicine found guilty of murdering his patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm Strangerinblood.co.uk] [[Nigel Cox (doctor)|Nigel Cox]] was convicted of attempted murder in 1992, in the death of Lillian Boyes.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bodkin Adams]] was charged in 1957 with murdering a patient, amid rumours he had killed dozens more over a 10-year period and "possibly provided the role model for Shipman". However, he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kinnell |first=HG |title=Serial homicide by doctors: Shipman in perspective |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1594–7 |year=2000 |pmid=11124192 |pmc=1119267 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Pamela Cullen has argued that because of Adams' acquittal, there was no impetus to examine the flaws in the British system until the Shipman case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last= Stovold|url=http://www.strangerinblood.co.uk/html/case.htm|title=Strangerinblood.co.uk|publisher=Strangerinblood.co.uk|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Shipman hanged&lt;!--the word "hanged" is correct in this context--&gt; himself in his cell at [[Wakefield Prison]] at 6:20&amp;nbsp;am on 13 January 2004, on the eve of his 58th birthday, and was pronounced dead at 8:10&amp;nbsp;am. A [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|Prison Service]] statement indicated that Shipman had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3391871.stm|date=13 January 2004|title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated, as his suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of Shipman's confession, nor answers as to why he committed his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3392135.stm|date=13 January 2004|work=BBC News|title=No mourning from Shipman families}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]] noted that celebration was tempting, saying: "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and you think, is it too early to open a bottle?

His death divided national newspapers, with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' branding him a "cold coward" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen. However, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran a celebratory front-page headline; "Ship Ship hooray!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon|title=Is it the Sun that's gone bonkers?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jan/19/sun.mondaymediasection|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=19 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' called for the inquiry into Shipman's suicide to look more widely at the state of Britain's prisons as well as the welfare of inmates.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3395065.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shipman's death divides papers | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', an article by Sir [[David Ramsbotham]], a former [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons|Chief Inspector of Prisons]], suggested that [[whole life tariff|whole life sentencing]] be replaced by [[indefinite sentencing]], for this would at least give prisoners the hope of eventual release and reduce the risk of their ending their own lives by suicide as well as making their management easier for prison officials.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

Shipman's motive for suicide was never established, though he reportedly told his [[probation officer]] that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his [[NHS Pension Scheme|National Health Service (NHS) pension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3611019.stm|date=8 April 2004|title=Shipman leaves his wife £24,000|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Primrose Shipman received a full NHS pension; she would not have been entitled to it if Shipman had lived past 60.&lt;ref name="Not preventable"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4182730.stm|title=Shipman suicide 'not preventable'|work=BBC News|date=25 August 2005 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was evidence that his wife, who had consistently protested Shipman's innocence despite the overwhelming evidence, had begun to suspect his guilt. Shipman refused to take part in courses which would have encouraged acknowledgement of his crimes, leading to a temporary removal of privileges, including the opportunity to telephone his wife.&lt;ref name="Not preventable"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3391871.stm | work=BBC News | title=Harold Shipman found dead in cell | date=13 January 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, according to Shipman's cellmate, he received a letter from Primrose exhorting him to, "Tell me everything, no matter what."&lt;ref name="Sweet2004" /&gt; A 2005 inquiry found that Shipman's suicide "could not have been predicted or prevented," but that procedures should nonetheless be re-examined.&lt;ref name="Not preventable" /&gt;
&lt;!--
Some asked why he had not been on [[suicide watch]] at HMP Wakefield, even though he had been earlier at [[Manchester (HM Prison)|HMP Manchester]] and [[Frankland (HM Prison)|HMP Frankland]] after threatening to kill himself.
--&gt;

==Aftermath==
In January 2001, [[Chris Gregg]], a senior [[West Yorkshire]] detective, was selected to lead an investigation into 22 of the West Yorkshire deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How many more did Shipman kill? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-many-more-did-shipman-kill-630689.html |date=9 October 2001 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=19 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the Shipman Inquiry into Shipman's activities, submitted in July 2002, concluded that he had killed at least 215 of his patients between 1975 and 1998, during which time he practiced in Todmorden, West Yorkshire (1974–1975), and [[Hyde, Greater Manchester]] (1977–1998). Dame [[Janet Smith (judge)|Janet Smith]], the judge who submitted the report, admitted that many more deaths of a suspicious nature could not be definitively ascribed to him. Most of his victims were elderly women in good health.&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"/&gt;

In her sixth and final report, issued on 24 January 2005, Smith reported that she believed that Shipman had killed three patients, and she had serious suspicions about four further deaths, including that of a four-year-old girl, during the early stage of his medical career at Pontefract General Infirmary in [[Pontefract]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In total, 459 people died while under his care between 1971 and 1998, but it is uncertain how many of those were murder victims, as he was often the only doctor to certify a death. Smith's estimate of Shipman's total victim count over that 27-year period was 250.&lt;ref name = "shipman inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "killed early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4210581.stm |work=BBC News |title=Shipman 'killed early in career'|date=27 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Medical Council]] charged six doctors, who signed cremation forms for Shipman's victims, with misconduct, claiming they should have noticed the pattern between Shipman's home visits and his patients' deaths. All these doctors were found not guilty. In October 2005, a similar hearing was held against two doctors who worked at Tameside General Hospital in 1994, who failed to detect that Shipman had deliberately administered a "grossly excessive" dose of [[morphine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4305366.stm|title=Shipman doctors deny misconduct|work=BBC News|date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4331208.stm|title=Shipman doctor 'not good enough'|date=11 October 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shipman Inquiry recommended changes to the structure of the General Medical Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4081425.stm |title=Shipman report demands GMC reform |date=9 December 2004|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, it came to light that Shipman may have stolen jewellery from his victims. In 1998, police had seized over £10,000 worth of jewellery they found in his garage. In March 2005, when Primrose Shipman asked for its return, police wrote to the families of Shipman's victims asking them to identify the jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4357193.stm|title=Theft fears over 'Shipman gems'|work=BBC News|date=17 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/4446593.stm|title=Twenty make Shipman jewels claims|work=BBC News|date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/aug/31/shipman.uknews|title=Shipman's stolen gems found in his wife's jewellery box|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 August 2005|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unidentified items were handed to the [[Assets Recovery Agency]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4574147.stm|title=Shipman jewels not going to widow|work=BBC News|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation ended in August. Authorities returned 66 pieces to Primrose Shipman and auctioned 33 pieces that she confirmed were not hers. Proceeds of the auction went to Tameside Victim Support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4197812.stm|work=BBC News|title=Shipman stole victim's jewellery|date=31 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/shipman/Story/0,,1559544,00.html|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Shipman's stolen gems found in his wife's jewellery box|date=31 August 2005 | location=London | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only piece returned to a murdered patient's family was a platinum diamond ring, for which the family provided a photograph as proof of ownership.

A memorial garden to Shipman's victims, called the Garden of Tranquillity, opened in Hyde Park, [[Hyde, Greater Manchester|Hyde]] on 30 July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4731119.stm |title=Garden tribute to Shipman victims |date=30 July 2005|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2009, families of over 200 of the victims of Shipman were still seeking compensation for the loss of their relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alexanderharris.co.uk/article/Nurse_convicted_of_murder_of_two_patients_by_lethal_injection_2588.asp |title=Alexander Harris, the law firm who represented families of victims of Allitt and Shipman |date=25 August 2006 |publisher=Alexander Harris |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930061847/http://alexanderharris.co.uk/article/Nurse_convicted_of_murder_of_two_patients_by_lethal_injection_2588.asp |archivedate=30 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, authorities announced that letters Shipman wrote in prison would be sold at auction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Shipman effect===
The Shipman case, and a series of recommendations in the Shipman Inquiry report, led to changes to standard medical procedures in Britain (now referred to as the "Shipman effect"). Many doctors reported changes in their dispensing practices, and a reluctance to risk over-prescribing pain medication may have led to under-prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5252902.stm|title='Shipman effect' harms pain care|last=|first=|date=7 August 2006|work=|accessdate=23 December 2014|publisher=BBC|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30192721|title=Shipman effect: How a serial killer changed medical practice forever|last=Queiro|first=Alicia|date=1 December 2014|website=BBC|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death certification practices were altered as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation Paper on Death Certification, Burial and Cremation|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/26131024/4|website=Scottish Government|accessdate=23 December 2014|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest change was the movement from single-doctor general practices to multiple-doctor general practices.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} This was not a direct recommendation, but rather because the report stated that there was not enough safeguarding and monitoring of doctors' decisions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The forms needed for a cremation in England and Wales have had their questions altered as a direct result of the Shipman case. For example, the person(s) organising the funeral must answer, 'Do you know or suspect that the death of the person who has died was violent or unnatural?  Do you consider that there should be any further examination of the remains of the person who has died?&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697075/cremation-form-1-app-for-cremation-of-body.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
''Harold and Fred (They Make Ladies Dead)'' was a 2001 strip cartoon in ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'', also featuring serial killer [[Fred West]]. Some relatives of Shipman's victims voiced anger at the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/viz-pushes-taste-to-its-limits-with-shipman-cartoon-705190.html |title='Viz' pushes taste to its limits with Shipman cartoon |work=[[The Independent]] |date=1 February 2001 |accessdate=6 March 2009 |last=Garrett |first=Jade |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223083641/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/viz-pushes-taste-to-its-limits-with-shipman-cartoon-705190.html |archivedate=23 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1148180.stm

''[[Harold Shipman: Doctor Death]]'', an [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] television dramatisation of the case, was made in 2002; it starred [[James Bolam]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306943 |title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death | medium=Television drama |year=2002 |people=Roger Bamford (Director)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was referenced in an episode of the 2003 [[CBS]] television [[medical drama]] series ''Diagnosis: Unknown'' called "Deadly Medicine" (Season 2, Episode 17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0559329| title=Diagnosis: Unknown: Deadly Medicine | medium=Television series |year=2003| people=Greg Francis (Director)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as Jack Halford in the [[BBC One]] television series ''[[New Tricks]]'' during the 2010 episode "Where There's Smoke", James Bolam mentions Shipman in a lecture on serial killers. The British sitcom ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]'' made use of the surnames of known English [[serial killers]] including Shipman for some of the main characters.&lt;ref name="independent surname"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html | title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin &amp; Stacey |date=21 November 2009 |work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary also titled ''Harold Shipman: Doctor Death'', with new witness testimony about the serial killer, was shown by [[ITV_(TV_channel)|ITV]] as part of its ''Crime &amp; Punishment'' strand on 26 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week17/harold-shipman-doctor-death|title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death|accessdate=17 April 2018|publisher=ITV Press Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was criticised as offering "little new insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2018/04/26/harold-shipman-doctor-death-review-20-years-documentary-offered/|title=Harold Shipman: Doctor Death, review: 20 years on, this documentary offered little new insight|first=Gerard|last=O'Donovan|date=26 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] refer to Shipman in their song "What About Us?" on the 2005 album ''[[Fall Heads Roll]]''. The lyrics of the song mention a "doctor giving out morphine" and the chorus includes singer [[Mark E. Smith]] and backing singers chanting in call and response, "What about us? (Shipman!)"

The [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (season 3)|third season ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'']] episode "D.A.W." was based on the Shipman murder case.

A play titled ''Beyond Belief - Scenes From the Shipman Inquiry'', written by Dennis Woolf and directed by Chris Honer was performed at the Library Theatre, Manchester, 20 October – 22 November 2004. The script of the play comprised edited verbatim extracts from [[The Shipman Inquiry]], spoken by actors playing the witnesses and lawyers at the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/theatre-news/play-exposes-legacy-of-shipman-horror-1126194|title=Play exposes legacy of Shipman horror|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=22 October 2004|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided a "stark narrative" that focused on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rushforth|first=Bruno|date=4 November 2004|title=Beyond Belief: Scenes from the Shipman Inquiry|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/329/7474/1109|journal=BMJ|volume=329|issue=7474|pages=1109|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7474.1109|pmc=526136|issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amelia Sach and Annie Walters 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Amelia Sach and Annie Walters in the dock in 1903]]
'''Amelia Sach''' (1873 – 3 February 1903) and '''Annie Walters''' (1869 – 3 February 1903) were two [[United Kingdom|British]] murderers better known as ''the [[Finchley]] [[baby-farming|baby farmers]]''.

==Crimes==
Amelia Sach operated a "[[lying-in]]" home in Stanley Road, and later at Claymore House in Hertford Road (both in [[East Finchley]]), [[London]]. Around 1900,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 121]&lt;/ref&gt; she began to advertise that babies "could be left", and took money for adoptions. The clients, judging from the witness accounts, were mostly servants from local houses who had become pregnant, and who had employers who were keen for the matter to be resolved discreetly. There was a charge for [[lying-in]], and another for adoption, a "present" to future parents of between £25 and £30.

Annie Walters would collect the baby after it was born, and then dispose of the child with a poisonous mixture—[[chlorodyne]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 123]&lt;/ref&gt; (a medicine containing [[morphine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caversham.otago.ac.nz/resource/biographies/emmelineThomasGalloway.html|title=The Caversham Project : University of Otago|first=History|last=Department|website=caversham.otago.ac.nz|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
[[File:Execution of Sach and Walters 1903.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The double execution of Sach and Walters at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]]]]
They were caught after Walters raised the suspicions of her landlord in [[Islington]] who was a police officer. An unknown number of babies were murdered this way, although the figure is considered to be in excess of a dozen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.executedtoday.com/2017/02/03/1903-amelia-sach-and-annie-walters-the-finchley-baby-farmers/ ''executedtoday.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Women Serial and Mass Murderers: A Worldwide Reference: 1580-1990'' {{ISBN|978-0-899-50680-7}} p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; During their trial at the [[Old Bailey]], the quantity of baby clothes found at Claymore House was used as evidence to indicate the sheer scale of their crimes. A local campaign to have their sentences commuted to life failed, and they became the first women to be [[hanged]] at [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]] on 3 February 1903, by [[William Billington]], in what was the only double hanging of women to be carried out in modern times.

==Background==
Little is known about Annie Walters, but Sach's background is well-documented: Amelia Sach was baptised Frances Amelia Thorne in [[Hampreston]], Dorset, on 5 May 1867. She was the fourth child of ten and had three sisters. She married a builder called Jeffrey Sach in 1896. Sach was active long before she engaged Walters. By 1902 she was working from 'Claymore House', a semi-detached, red-brick villa in East Finchley, North London.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1394309/Baby-killer-Amelia-Sach-Penninah-Ashers-family-Researching-background-popular--past-hide-horrific-secrets.html|title=The baby killer in my family: Researching your background has never been so popular...but the past can hide horrific secrets|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sach was herself a mother; the England and Wales census of 1901 shows that a child was born to her in [[Clapham]]. She lied about her age – she was 32, not 29. Walters' background is unknown, but she had been married. She seems to have had a drinking problem and she would periodically advertise herself as a sick nurse. On her arrest she was determined to be "feeble", that is to say, feeble-minded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lO90EM43TLUC&amp;pg=PA122 Jennifer Furio, ''Team Killers a Comparative Study of Collaborative'', 2001. Page 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small possibility that the pair may have been involved in an earlier homicide that resulted in another woman being executed.  In 1899, [[Louise Masset]] was tried for the murder of her young son Manfred, whose body was found in the ladies' lavatory at [[Dalston Junction railway station]]. [[Circumstantial evidence]] suggested that Louise was the murderer, and the killing was to be rid of a supposed encumbrance due to her wanting to marry a man named Lucas.  However, in her claims of innocence, Louise said she had taken Manfred out of the care of one woman to give him to two ladies she met who had an establishment for the care of growing children.  The police claimed they made some effort in looking for the two women, but the extent of their investigation is unknown.  In any event, Louise Masset was tried and convicted of the murder and, despite a petition for mercy, was executed on 9 January 1900.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Amelia Sach Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Tombstone showing the name of Amelia Sach]]
[[File:Annie Walters Grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|Tombstone showing the name of Annie Walters]]
The bodies of Sach and Walters were buried in [[unmarked grave]]s within the walls of Holloway Prison, as was customary. In 1971 the prison underwent an extensive programme of rebuilding, during which the bodies of all the executed women were exhumed. With the exception of [[Ruth Ellis]], the remains of the four other women executed at Holloway (i.e. [[Styllou Christofi]], [[Edith Thompson]], Sach and Walters) were subsequently reburied in a single grave (plot 117) at [[Brookwood Cemetery]]. The grave is marked with a horizontally laid grey granite tombstone, and the names of all the occupants are engraved on it. The precise location of Sach and Walters' grave within Brookwood Cemetery is {{coord|51|18|13.67|N|0|37|33.33|W|region:GB_scale:1000|display=inline}}. The remains of Thompson were exhumed in 2018 and laid to rest in the grave of her mother and father in the [[City of London Cemetery and Crematorium|City of London Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Lusher, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/edith-thompson-death-penalty-capital-punishment-hanging-miscarriage-justice-buried-mother-murder-a8647636.html Lsid to rest at last: Edith Thompson, victim of a 'barbarous, misogynistic death penalty' - ''[[The Independent]]'' 22 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Claymore House", the semi-detached, red-brick villa where Sach had lived and worked in 1902 acquired a bad reputation due to the criminal activities which took place there. Some time after the trial of Sach and Walters, the building had its name chiselled off the stone plaque above the window and is now anonymous.&lt;ref name="dailymail1"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of [[Nicola Upson]]'s novel ''Two for Sorrow'' (2010, Faber &amp; Faber, London; Harper, New York) revolves around the aftermath of the Finchley Baby Farming affair.  Both Sach and Walters appear as characters.

'''Margarita Sánchez Gutiérrez''' (born December 26, 1953 in [[Málaga]]), also known as the "Black Widow of [[Barcelona]]" and "The Black Widow of Hospitalet", was a [[Spain|Spanish]] serial killer who received her name for her method of murder - by poisoning the food and drinks she offered her victims. She managed to kill four people and poisoned three others who managed to survive. All of the victims were close to her, including family members and neighbours.

== Biography ==
When she moved to [[Catalonia]] she first lived in [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]], on Riera Blanca Street, where she was known as "la bizca". This was a modest neighbourhood of workers, where she was considered a troubled woman, but without a criminal record. According to neighbours, she was prone to insults and street fights, and had debts in some shops in the area; she was greedy and seemingly illiterate according to what she declared to police. In 1991 Margarita moved with her husband, Luis Navarro, and their children Sonia and Javi to their in-laws' floor, partly because they had been discouraged but also to take care of her husband's father. Margarita and Carmen Nuez, her mother-in-law, did not get along because apparently the latter was a woman of authority and great character. In 1992, the father-in-law died and Carmen was hospitalized five times in the Clinical Hospital where she proclaimed her daughter-in-law is poisoning her. However, the performing analyzers gave a negative results. Currently, since 2016 she lives in the La Maurina neighbourhood of [[Terrassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/buzon/nicho/abierto/elpepiopi/19960801elpepiopi_1/Tes|title=Un buzón como un nicho abierto|publisher=ELPAÍS.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sentence ==
Margarita Sánchez Gutiérrez was sentenced to 34 years in prison for three crimes of injury, another three for robbery with violence and one crime for falsehood. She was acquitted of the murders when no cases of death due to cyanide were detected and because Margarita's intention was to drug and rob her relatives, not to kill them, according to the justice.

'''Abdelkader Salhi M.''' (born 1969), known as the '''10 Killer''', is a suspected [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]] who murdered at least three prostitutes in [[Spain]] between August and September 2011. He is currently awaiting sentencing.&lt;ref name=victim&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://sevilla.abc.es/andalucia/malaga/20150602/sevi-victimas-invisibles-salhi-201506012013.html|title=The invisible victims of Salhi|author=Pablo D. Almoguera|publisher=[[ABC News|ABC News Sevilla]]|date=6 February 2015|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and move to Spain==
A native of Wiesbaden, Germany, Salhi was born to a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] father and a German mother. He developed a deep disgust towards prostitutes from a young age, since his mother's extramarital activities resulted in the separation of his parents.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt; In 1988, while trying to rob a woman, Salhi killed her, which landed him an 18 year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=double&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.surinenglish.com/20111009/news/costasol-malaga/double-costa-killer-already-201110091819.html|title=Double Costa killer had already been convicted of murder in Germany|author=Juan Cano|publisher=Surinenglish.com|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Salhi illegally moved to Spain in 2007 under another identity, settling in a residence at Fontana Beach, Riviera del Sol.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; According to his Moroccan girlfriend, Sara Er Rezyni, he was constantly jealous when it came to his privacy and constantly avoided contradicting himself.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt; He also held four forged passports (including Irish, French and Italian) and spoke four languages.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2011/09/29/costa-del-sol-serial-killer-arrested/#.XLCrBDAzbIV|title='Costa del Sol Serial Killer' arrested|publisher=[[EuroWeekly News]]|date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
According to investigating authorities, Salhi contacted his victims through telephone after seeing their adverts in a local English-language newspaper. In order to gain their trust, he first visited them several times, having casual sex with them. After killing the women, he would steal their mobile phones, cash and credit cards, with his girlfriend later withdrawing 1,000 euros from the first two victims' bank accounts.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; Sara's mother was later found out to be in possession of one of the phones.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;

===Susana Monterroso===
Originally from [[Argentina]] but with Spanish nationality, the 45-year-old Monterroso was killed in her rented apartment at the Complejo Alhamar in Calahonda on August 10, 2011. She had been stabbed 17 times, with a pillowcase later being tied around her neck and a pillow put on her head. Her son found her body the following morning.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

===Brigitte SR===
The 49-year-old German prostitute was found dead by police at her Calahonda apartment on September 2, although it was estimated that she had died a week before. At the time of discovery, the corpse was at an advanced stage of decomposition, but police managed to find that Salhi's number was the last one the victim had called before her death.

===Maryuri Alice Pérez García===
The 47-year-old [[Ecuador]]ian-born Pérez was killed at her shared apartment in San Pedro de Alcantara on September 10. She had been stabbed 13 times and then robbed of her phone, credit card and 100 euros.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; It was noted that in this instance, the killer had taken the knife with him, but after the murder, had cleaned it up before leaving it at a kitchen drawer in Pérez's house.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
Detectives working on both cases began developing a theory that the murders were committed by the same person, backed up by the fact that the victims were supposedly chosen because they were vulnerable women who received their clients in rented flats. Through examination of phone records, they received another clue to the killer's identity, but the discovery came after 2,000 euros were withdrawn from one of the women's bank accounts.&lt;ref name=double/&gt;

Authorities later arrested Salhi while he was working out in a local gym under the assumed name of Martin Sparitt. During the subsequent five hour investigation, he confessed to the Costa del Sol murders, providing great detail in both instances.&lt;ref name=double/&gt; Brigitte SR's case was later connected to the series, and he is currently being investigated for possible other murders around Spain.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

Despite the evidence presented, Salhi later recanted his confessions, claiming that the arresting officers had threatened and beaten him into signing the confessions. However, Rezyni admitted during questioning that on the day of one the murders, she had seen wounds on Abdelkader. Currently, his trial continues, and if convicted, Salhi could face up to 63 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;

'''Moses Sithole ''' (born 17 November 1964) is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] and [[rapist]] who committed the '''ABC Murders''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm|title=Worst criminals of SA|last=Kendal|first=Rebekah|date=3 May 2007|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=3 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084655/http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm|archive-date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; so named because they began in [[Atteridgeville]], continued in [[Boksburg, Gauteng|Boksburg]] and finished in [[Cleveland, Gauteng|Cleveland]], a [[suburb]] of [[Johannesburg]]. Sithole murdered at least 38 people between 16 July 1994 and 6 November 1995.

==Early life==
Moses Sithole was born on 17 November 1964 in [[Vosloorus]], a township near [[Boksburg]], [[Transvaal Province]] (now known as [[Gauteng]]). When he was five years old, his father died, and his mother abandoned the family.&lt;ref name="Greig2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/176 176]|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sithole and his siblings spent the next three years in an [[Orphanage#South_Africa|orphanage]], where he later said they were mistreated. By his own account, Sithole was arrested for [[rape]] in his teens and spent seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt; He later blamed his imprisonment for turning him into a murderer. He explained his crimes by saying that the women he murdered all reminded him of the women who had falsely accused him of rape years before.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

==Murders==
Sithole appeared to be a mild-mannered individual to those around him. At the time of his crimes, he was managing a [[shell organization]], Youth Against Human Abuse, ostensibly devoted to the eradication of [[child abuse]]. After committing murders in Atteridgeville, near [[Pretoria]], Sithole moved his focus to Boksburg and eventually to [[Cleveland, Gauteng|Cleveland]]. By 1995, he had claimed over thirty victims, sparking nationwide panic. In some cases, he would later phone the victims' families for no other apparent reason than to taunt them.&lt;ref&gt;[[A&amp;E Biography]] - Moses Sithole&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] visited Boksburg in person to appeal for public assistance in apprehending the killer.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

===Methods===
Sithole targeted black women between the ages of 18 and 45 years old. Most of his victims were being interviewed for positions with Sithole's [[ersatz]] charity. Sithole would take them to remote fields, where he would beat, rape, and murder them. They were generally [[strangulation|strangled]] with their own underwear. He once inflicted a head wound on the two-year-old son of one of his victims and left him to die from exposure.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;

==Capture==
In August 1995, Sithole was identified as having been seen with one of the victims, but he disappeared shortly after [[South African Police Service|SAPS]] investigators learned details of his previous rape conviction. In October 1995, Sithole contacted South African journalist Tamsen de Beer and identified himself as the wanted murderer.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt; During a phone conversation with de Beer, he indicated that the killings were carried out in revenge for his unjust imprisonment and claimed 76 victims, twice as many as those reported. Finally, in order to prove his identity, Sithole gave directions to where one of the bodies had been left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|title=Evil Serial Killers: In the Minds of Monsters|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|isbn=0760775664|page=[https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/177 177]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/evilserialkiller00char/page/177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities subsequently cornered Sithole in [[Johannesburg]], shooting the suspect when he attacked a constable with a [[hatchet]]. Sithole was driven to the hospital, where he was found to be [[HIV]] positive.&lt;ref name="Greig2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= South African Strangler: Moses Sithole|url=http://www.biography.com/tv/notorious/episodes/south-african-strangler|series= Notorious|network= The Biography Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
On 5 December 1997, Sithole was sentenced to fifty years' imprisonment for each of the thirty-eight murders, twelve years' imprisonment for each of the forty rapes, and five years' imprisonment for each of six [[robbery|robberies]]. Since his [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] run consecutively, the total effective sentence is one of 2,410 years. Justice David Carstairs ordered that Sithole would be required to serve at least 930 years before being eligible for [[parole]]. The judge also told Sithole that had [[capital punishment]] [[Capital punishment in South Africa|not been abolished]], he would have been sentenced to death. Sithole was incarcerated in [[C Max|C-Max]], the maximum security section of [[Pretoria]] Central Prison. He is currently incarcerated in Mangaung Correctional Centre in [[Bloemfontein]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}

'''Norman Avzal Simons''' (born 12 January 1967), also known as the "'''Station Strangler,'''" is a [[South Africa]]n [[rape|rapist]] and [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 1995 of the rape and murder of 10-year-old Elroy van Rooy. He was sentenced to 35 years (25 for murder and 10 for kidnapping) in prison.&lt;ref name="sstrangler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Candice|title=Revisiting the Station Strangler cases|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/revisiting-the-station-strangler-cases-1.250970|accessdate=16 December 2015|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=16 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Simons was an intelligent individual who enjoyed playing classical music and was capable of speaking seven languages including English, [[Afrikaans]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="teacher"&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/S/SIMONS_norman_afzal.php. Serial Killer Crime Index.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was employed as a Grade Five teacher at Alpine Primary School in Beacon Valley, [[Mitchell's Plain]].&lt;ref name=sstrangler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitaker|first1=Raymond|title=Coloured teacher charged in 'Cape Strangler' murder|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/coloured-teacher-charged-in-cape-strangler-murder-1371008.html|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=19 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons' victims were all young boys aged between 9 and 13.&lt;ref name="victims"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm |title=iAfrica : ''Worst Criminals of South Africa.'' |access-date=6 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141639/http://news.iafrica.com/features/827627.htm |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simons and his victims were from the [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Man Who Killed Boy S. Africa's Serial Strangler?|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/422660/IS-MAN-WHO-KILLED-BOY-S-AFRICAS-SERIAL-STRANGLER.html?pg=all|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=14 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simons is believed to have started his sporadic series of murders in 29 October 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iol.co.za/news/station-strangler-up-for-parole-1687793 ''Station Strangler up for Parole'']&lt;/ref&gt; ending only with his arrest nine years later in April 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspect held in 21 killings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19940711&amp;id=ZTQdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jaUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2361,3122136&amp;hl=en|accessdate=16 December 2015|work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=11 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected his moniker after it became apparent that most of his victims were lured away from train stations (Soviet serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]] had a similar ''modus operandi'').

Simons raped and sodomised his victims before strangling them. Victims were found face down with their hands tied behind their backs, buried in shallow sandy graves. In some cases the victims were found with their underwear around their necks, presumably used as a garrote. Hand-written notes were also found next to some victims.&lt;ref name="victims"/&gt; Simons' relationship with his older stepbrother seems to have a major bearing on his criminal activities. Simons alleges that his older stepbrother raped and sodomised him as a child. He also reports 'hearing voices' from his brother instructing him to kill. Simons' brother, an alcoholic, was murdered in 1991.

Simons appeared before magistrates in 1995 on one charge of murder and kidnap. His trial lasted three months, leading to a conviction and life sentence. He is currently serving his sentence in [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre|Drakenstein Maximum Correctional Facility]], [[Paarl]]. Simons appealed against his conviction in 1998, but his conviction was upheld.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 2005, an inquest was opened into the deaths of the remaining victims. After three years of further analysis, the victims' parents came no closer to an answer. On 9 December 2008, Regional Magistrate Marelize Rolle stated that she believed ''prima facie'' evidence showed Simons was probably responsible for the deaths of at least six of the other victims. However, due to the amount of time that had passed, she ruled out further prosecutions in the case.&lt;ref name="prosecution"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200812100149.html Cape Argus : ''No further prosecutions for Simons.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Norman Simons converted to Islam in 1993, taking on the name Avzal, but converted back to Christianity in 1994.&lt;ref name="Name"&gt;Pistorious, M. 2005. ''Profiling Serial Killers and other crimes in South Africa''. Penguin Books, South Africa. page 170. {{ISBN|0-14-302482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Sidyno''' is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 2000 of 7 murders and sentenced to 7 [[Life Sentence]]s in prison.&lt;ref name="Sentence"&gt;[http://www.sundaytribune.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=159&amp;fArticleId=qw968152741272B263. ‘‘Sunday Tribune’’ : Sadistic Serial Killer gets seven life terms.]&lt;/ref&gt; His victims all came from the [[Pretoria]] area of [[Gauteng]].

Sidyno undertook a murderous rampage starting November 1998 and culminating with his arrest on 6 January 1999. He killed and disposed of his victims in the Capital Park hills of [[Pretoria]], a deserted area of hills near the city centre and [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa|Pretoria Zoo]].

== Victims ==
His victims included two adult women; Paulinah Ledwaba and Elizabeth Senwamadi. He also killed five youths, only two of whom could be identified; Ronald Maoka and Emmanuel Mavuka. Sidyno assaulted and strangled his victims before re-clothing them and covering their bodies with brush. He was noted for removing his victims shoes and placing them neatly next to their bodies.&lt;ref name="Conviction"&gt;[http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=672&amp;fArticleId=qw967653421636B263. ‘‘Pretoria News’’ : Pretoria Serial Killer convicted of 7 murders.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convictions ==
On 30 August 2000, Sidyno was convicted of the seven murders. He was sentenced by Judge Johan van der Westhuizen on 5 September 2000 to seven life terms with a recommended 40 years in jail before he could be paroled. The judge said an expert on [[serial killer]]s had described Sidyno as a [[psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] sexual [[murder]]er, adding that Sidyno could therefore not be rehabilitated.&lt;ref name="Sentence"/&gt;

'''Khangayi Sedumedi''' (born '''Kangai Sedumedi''', 1977, in [[Gugulethu]], [[Western Cape]]), also known as '''The Century City Killer''', is a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] and rapist, responsible for the murders of between four to six women in the aforementioned [[Cape Town]] neighborhood between 2011 and 2015.&lt;ref name=rev&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/century-city-killers-modus-operandi-revealed-2032665|title=Century City killer's modus operandi revealed|author=Catherine Rice|publisher=IOL|date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted on four counts and given seven life sentences in 2016, and is currently incarcerated at an unnamed prison in Cape Town.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.npa.gov.za/sites/default/files/media-releases/2016%20June%2013%20-%20Serial%20Rapist%20And%20Murderer%20Sentenced%20To%207%20Life%20Sentences%20Plus%2040%20Years.pdf|title=Serial Rapist and Murdered Sentenced to 7 Life Sentences Plus 40 Years|author=Eric Ntabazalia|publisher=[[National Prosecuting Authority]]|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
Born as the only child of [[Shona people|Shona]] man Adam Wapaka and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] Jacqueline Sedumedi, he was named Kangai at birth, but Xhosa relatives from the family pronounced it as Khangayi.&lt;ref name=good&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/century-city-killer-was-my-good-pal-2033655|title=Century City killer was my good pal|author=Roland Thabo Mpofu|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised by his grandmother, who had him regularly attend services at the local church, along with his aunt and cousins. Khangayi was given the nickname "Jesus" by childhood friends, as he never got angry at anybody no matter the circumstances, and always avoided fighting with other youths.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;

In 1990, Sedumedi's mother Jacqueline disappeared suddenly, with her whereabouts still unknown.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; This took a great toll on the young Khangayi, who became a shy loner who avoided having his picture taken, to the point where even his own family didn't have any photographs of him. Even stranger, in the years prior to his arrest, he would disappear mysteriously for weeks on end, only to later return saying that he was "just around". In 2012, he vanished for almost a year before suddenly resurfacing in 2013, claiming he had been in [[France]].&lt;ref name=good/&gt;

Despite his odd behavior and frequent vanishings, Sedumedi was regarded as a hard worker and an ambitious person, with a passion for the [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]]. In 2003, he quickly befriended Roland Thabo Mpofu, whom Khangayi treated as a brother and referred to by the nickname "TaTibo". Mpofu, whom later married one of Sedumedi's cousins, noted in a later interview that Khangayi always spoke highly of his all-female cousins and was never visibly violent to women. However, he and the family alike were puzzled by the fact that he had never spoken of a girlfriend or even a female friend.&lt;ref name=good/&gt; Before his arrest, he was working as a security guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2016/06/10/NPA-satisfied-with-sentencing-of-CT-serial-rapist|title=NPA satisfied with sentencing of CT serial rapist|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=Eyewitness News|date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Murders, trial and imprisonment==
In the period between November 2011 and January 2015, a series of violent crimes against women occurred in the Cape Town suburbs of [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]] and [[Kensington, Cape Town|Kensington]], mostly centered around the train station in Century City. A total of eight victims were raped, with six of them being murdered by their attacker: the youngest being a 15-year-old, who was raped both vaginally and anally, and sustained multiple injuries during her assault. The bodies of the deceased were discovered in a field near Acre Road between February and December 2014, all of them naked and with their hands tied behind their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2015/09/18/Alleged-Century-City-Killer-case-to-be-heard-in-high-court|title='Century City Killer' case transferred to WC High Court|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=[[Eyewitness News (South Africa)|Eyewitness News]]|date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to catch the perpetrator and calm down the frightened community, Cape Town Mayor [[Patricia de Lille]] offered a reward of 50,000 [[South African rand|rands]] to anybody who could help capture the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://ewn.co.za/2015/01/09/Man-arrested-for-Kensington-serial-killings|title=Man arrested for Kensington serial killings|author=Shamiela Fisher|publisher=Eyewitness News|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2015, Sedumedi was taken in for questioning regarding the crimes. Before long, he was charged with 23 counts, including eight rapes, four murders, two kidnappings, five robberies with aggravating circumstances, attempted robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted rape and assault, all before the Goodwood Magistrates Court. He entered into a plea deal and confessed his guilt to all but two of the charges.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; While in court, he explained his [[modus operandi]]: selecting his victims, mostly young jobseekers, at random, he approached the women under the pretext of possible job opportunities.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; He obtained their contact details, and would later phone the victim, claiming to have secured them a job interview. Agreeing to meet on a specific date, he would ambush the victim in an isolated place, where he would rape, rob and kill them. In some instances, he used a plastic toy gun to force them into submission.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt; He also confessed to murdering the women so they could not identify him later on.&lt;ref name=life/&gt; Taking into account all the charges against him, Justice John Hlope gave him seven life sentences, as well as an additional 40 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref name=rev/&gt;

'''Jozef Slovák''' (born 1951) is a [[Slovak people|Slovak]] [[serial killer]] who murdered at least five women in [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] from 1978 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluska.sk/slovensko/vrah-genius.html|title=Vrah génius!|language=Slovak|work=www.pluska.sk|date=9 June 2008|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently serving a life sentence for four murders in [[Ilava]] Prison in [[Slovakia]].

Slovák remains one of the most significant participants in the controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aktualne.centrum.sk/domov/kauzy/clanek.phtml?id=1148375|title=Psychopat chcel sex s matkou obete|language=Slovak|work=Aktuálne.sk|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wide-ranging [[amnesty]] of the newly elected President of [[Czechoslovakia]] [[Václav Havel]]. Because of this amnesty, Slovák served only eight years in prison for the murder of a 21-year-old Yugoslavian woman, and after his release, murdered at least four other young women in less than a year and a half before again being captured.

Jozef Slovák met his first victim, [[Yugoslavia]]n woman Blažica P. on a train. On August 22, 1978, he took her into the woods in [[Bratislava]], Železná studnička (today part of [[Bratislava Forest Park]]) and tried to have sex with her. As she refused and tried to fight back, he choked her to death. After the murder, he dragged her body deeper into the forest and covered it with branches. After burning some of Blažica P.'s clothing right there in the forest, he gave some of the things she had on her body to his girlfriend.

In 1982, Slovák was sentenced to 15 years in prison for this first murder. He started to serve his sentence in [[Leopoldov Prison]] but was released on probation March 10, 1990 because of a wide-ranging amnesty by president of Czechoslovakia [[Václav Havel]]. Almost two-thirds of Czechoslovak criminals at that time were released from prison practically at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aktualne.atlas.sk/rekorderom-v-udelovani-milosti-bol-prezident-kovac/slovensko/politika/|title=Rekordérom v udeľovaní milostí bol prezident Kováč|language=Slovak|work=Aktuálne.sk|date=4 April 2009|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many murderers, career criminals and other dangerous people were released from prisons on probation or parole. Without the amnesty, Slovák would not have been released until 1997. From 1990 to 1991, Slovák murdered at least four women, committing his second murder just four months after being released from prison.

He met his second victim, Monika Ondíková (from [[Moldava nad Bodvou]], [[Slovakia]]), in [[Prague]]. On July 4, 1990, he left the capital with her for [[Konopiště]], near [[Benešov]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) southeast of Prague. In the manor park, Jozef Slovák shot her 8 times from his [[Gas pistol|gas gun]], using neuroparalytic gas. Then, he hit her in the head several times with a stick, killing her. He searched the body, finding and stealing US$2,400, 800 German marks, over 16,000 Austrian schillings, a ring and her makeup. Again, he dragged the body deeper into the nearby forest and covered it with branches. Slovák returned to her body a week later to put a railway ticket to [[České Budějovice]] into her pocket, trying to confuse the police.

Two days after his last murder, Slovák was arrested in [[Bratislava]]. Bruises were found on his body caused by Anna Královičová's. The police also found an illegal firearm.

On August 20, 1993, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the City Court of [[Bratislava]] for the murders of Monika Ondíková, Vladislava Maříková, Diana Lopuchovská and Anna Královičová.

In 1997, Slovák complained to [[Ilava]] city representatives that he was unable to create any new inventions in his field of electronics, mainly because of the lack of tools not having access to a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/ilava/galeriaobrazovnao873354240.phtml |title=Galéria obrazov na oddelení výnimočných trestov |language=sk |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143735/http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/ilava/galeriaobrazovnao873354240.phtml |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality and psychopathological profile ==
Jozef Slovák is of above average intelligence, and is the author and holder of several patents in electronics. Psychologists arranged by the court found him to be a [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] [[psychopath]].

'''Mariusz Sowiński''' (born 1976) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[serial killer]], rapist and [[zoophile]] called the "[[Stefankowice]] Vampire". In the years 1994 to 1997, he raped and killed four women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.karasmierci.info.pl/hrub1997.html|title=Article about Sowiński|publisher=karasmierci.pl|date=1997|language=Polish|access-date=2018-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630083700/http://www.karasmierci.info.pl/hrub1997.html|archive-date=2007-06-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes ==
Sowiński committed his first murder in 1994. In Stefankowice, he raped and murdered Zofia K., and her body was thrown into the well. His next attack was a year later. In [[Kułakowice Pierwsze|Kułakowice]], he raped Antonina E.l to erase any traces, he set her house on fire. The woman later died in hospital from her injuries. In August 1996, in a garden plot in [[Hrubieszów]] he raped and stabbed Wiesława Ł. His last murder was on the night of August 31 to September 1, 1997.

== Investigation and arrest ==
The initial suspect was a man named Kazimierz P., who served 19 months in prison. On the trail of Sowiński, the police had already fallen off in September 1997. He was a conscript soldier in the [[Nadwślańskie units of the Ministry of Interior and Administration]] in [[Sanok]]. During the interrogations, without any embarrassment or emotions, he confessed to the crimes. This, combined with other evidence gathered, was enough to prosecute him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.e-reporter.pl/index.php/component/k2/item/86-pokuta-potwora|title=The repentance of a monster|publisher=e-reporter.pl|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and sentence ==
The trial began in autumn 1998 in [[Zamość]] and from the very beginning was accompanied by great emotions. In October, during the first trial, the father of Wiesława Ł., one of Sowiński's victims, attacked him with an axe smuggled to court, wounding him in the back. Sowiński went to the hospital and the attacker was detained. However, thanks to the intercession of the voivodes of Zamość and the protests of his neighbors, he was released. After he recovered, his case was resumed. The prosecutor's office him of quadruple murder and rape. To emphasize how dangerous and deranged he was, the prosecutor cited that after one of the killings he killed the owner's cows and then began to interact sexually with their corpses. The accused himself refused to give explanations, he only said he was innocent. His advocate tried to prove that Sowiński can not be convicted because he is [[mentally ill]] is. 20 experts in the field of psychology and [[sexology]] were appointed in his case. Everyone clearly stated that he was fully sane, and his deviations could be even deeper. The prosecutor's office demanded the penalty of life imprisonment with the possibility of conditional release after 50 years. In 2000, the District Court of Zamość sentenced him to the highest penalty. The Court of Appeal in [[Lublin]] also upheld it on the grounds that Sowiński posed a threat to the environment. A year later, as a result of the cassation of Sowiński, the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] quashed the verdict and remitted it for re-examination. In 2002, the District Court of Zamość imposed on him a life imprisonment with the possibility of conditional release after serving 50 years of imprisonment. In 2003, the Court of Appeal in Lublin finally upheld the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.dziennikwschodni.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100416/LUBLIN/137450076|title=The serial killer "vampire" will not get half a million zlotys in damages|author=er|publisher=dziennikwschodni.pl|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment ==
Sowiński is serving a sentence in the [[Rzeszów-Załęże Criminal Facility]], in an one-person cell in the therapeutic ward. He repeatedly sued in court during the sanction: against the father of one of his victims, who attacked him with an axe when he was led to the courtroom, from whom he demanded PLN 13,000 for "moral damage and losses"; against two policemen who escorted him - demanded PLN 80,000 for "not providing him with adequate protection", and PLN 360 for "damaged clothing", in another case - against the District Prosecutor of Zamość, from whom he demanded PLN 500,000 in compensation for "the prosecutor being rude and did not allow him to get acquainted with the case file", and Sowiński brought the last action in 2010 against [[Radio Lublin]]. For using the term "vampire", he demanded compensation from the radio in the amount of PLN 500,000. All actions brought by Sowiński were validly dismissed.

While serving the penalty, he completed a journeyman's course in the profession of a basket-maker.

Since 2004, he has consistently sought a pardon from successive presidents of Poland: [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]], [[Lech Kaczyński]], and more recently (in 2011) - [[Bronisław Komorowski]]. So far, all the requests, due to the negative criminological prognosis (progressive progression of sexual dysfunction) have been treated negatively at the judicial stage, and thus left without further progress.

Mariusz Sowiński will be apply for conditional early release in early 2047, at the age of 71.

'''Maria Catherina van der Linden-Swanenburg''' (9 September 1839&amp;nbsp;– 11 April 1915) was a Dutch [[serial killer]] who murdered at least 27 people and was suspected of killing more than 90 people.

== Early life ==
Maria Swanenburg was the daughter of Clemens Swanenburg and Johanna Dingjan. After Maria's first two daughters died at a young age, she married Johannes van der Linden on 13 May 1868. The result of this marriage was five sons and two daughters. The marriage lasted until 29 January 1886.{{sfn|Moerman|2013|loc=§&amp;nbsp;1}}

Her nickname was "Goeie Mie" (Good Mie), which she received because of her amicable neighborly assistance in babysitting and taking care of the sick and elderly in [[Leiden]]'s poor neighborhood, where she herself lived.{{sfn|Rasovich|1995|loc=§&amp;nbsp;17}}{{sfn|Weterings|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3}}

== Murders ==
Her first victim was her own mother, in 1880; not long thereafter she poisoned her father as well.

It was established with certainty that at least 102 people were [[arsenic poisoning|poisoned with arsenic]] between 1880 and 1883. Twenty-seven of her victims were killed,{{sfn|Rasovich|1995|loc=§&amp;nbsp;8}} of whom 16 were her relatives.{{sfn|Rasovich|1995|loc=§&amp;nbsp;9}} The investigation included more than 90 suspicious deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Forty-five survivors sustained chronic health issues after having ingested the poison.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Swanenburg's motive was the payout of her victims' insurance or their inheritance. She had secured most of the insurance policies herself.{{sfn|Weterings|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;4}}

=== Capture and imprisonment ===
Swanenburg was caught after she poisened the Frankhuizen family in December 1883.{{sfn|Weterings|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;5}} Her trial began on 23 April 1885.{{sfn|Moerman|2013|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3}} Swanenburg was found guilty of having killed at least three victims and she was sentenced to life imprisonment in a correctional facility, where she died in 1915.{{sfn|Weterings|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;8}}

'''Michel Stockx''' (born in [[Lochristi]] in 1942 - died in [[Beverwijk]] on 25 September 2001) was a [[Belgian]] serial killer who worked as a truck driver in [[Assen]].

On 27 July 1991, he lured 11-year-old Jessica Laven from [[Blokker, Netherlands|Blokker]] out a swimming pool in [[Zwaag]]. Later she was found strangled in [[Bad Nieuweschans]]. During his interrogation, Stockx also confessed to abusing and murdering two [[Germany|German]] boys, 13-year-old Marco Weisser from [[Wiesbaden]] and 10-year-old Salim Thattil from [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße]].

There are also persistent rumours that Stockx is responsible for the death of 10-year-old Belgian girl Nathalie Geijsbregts. Sjaak H., a member of the Venlo Gang, claimed that Stockx would have told him if that were true. He was also questioned as a suspect in the murder of Cheryl Morriën from [[IJmuiden]] but he denied any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010691693:mpeg21:a1384|title=How the killer of Jessica Laven and two German boys was exposed|author=Cees Koring|publisher=De Telegraaf|date=11 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, his name is mentioned in connection to the murder of 10-year-old Anaïs Marcelli in [[Mulhouse]] in [[France]].

For the murders of Laven, Weisser and Thattil, Michel Stockx was sentenced to 20 years in prison in November 1992 and he was detained in the [[Scheveningen]] Penitentiary. A few months before his death there was a stir in the Netherlands when it turned out that he received a disability benefit in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.misdaadjournalist.nl/rapportages/michelstockxendedodekinderen.html|title='Michel Stockx and the dead children'|publisher=misdaadjournalist.nl|author=Hendrik Jan Korterink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2001, during his work therapy, he knocked over a bottle of turpentine and banged a fluorescent tube, causing a fire. More than 60% of his body was burned severely and he was transported to the [[burn center]] in [[Beverwijk]]. He died there on September 25. The parents of Jessica Laven were pleased with the news. According to the police, it was an accident, but the media speculated it was an assassination attempt or suicide. However, the authorities refuted these claims.

'''Alexander Ivanovich Skrynnik '''(1953–1981), known as the "'''Moldavian [[Andrei Chikatilo|Chikatilo]]'''", is a [[Soviet]] [[serial killer]] who committed his crimes in [[Yakutia]] and [[Kishinev]].

== Biography ==
The exact date and place of birth of Skrynnik is unclear (it is known that he lived Kishinev and in 1980 he was 27 years old).&lt;ref name="brw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brw.md/moldavskii-maniac-aleksander-skrynnikov|website=brw.md|title=Александр Скрынник. Молдавские маньяки ⋆ BRW Журнал|accessdate=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered himself a loser in his personal life, and envied other men. His marriage was unhappy: after he had a child, Skrynnik realized that he did not love his wife. One day, his friend Feodosiy Glukharyov boasted to him about his success in love. After this, Skrynnik made an advertisement in the newspaper that he was searching for a lover, but the girl he met infected him with [[venereal disease]], which made Skrynnik decide that women are the source of all the ills in the world, and must be destroyed.

=== Murders ===
In the mid-1970s, Skrynnik went to work in Yakutia. There he killed stewardess Nina Puganova, cutting off her breasts and genitals. Although her torn body was found, it did not lead to the killer, and the murder remained unsolved until Skrynnik's capture.

Later, Skrynnik returned to Kishinev, where he worked as a carpenter in the "Bucuria" factory, was an [[udarnik]] and a candidate member of the [[CPSU]]. In 1980, he committed another murder. He invited to a date Irina Trasyn, who had a seven-year-old child, treating her with ice cream before stabbing her multiple times with a knife. Skrynnin then removed her eyes and cut off her head, which he put in a briefcase. The killer then brought this portfolio to Glukharyov, attaching the following note to it:{{Cquote
| quote = Fedor, did you see the gift? This is your example. Prepare 10 thousand! Or your daughter will be headless too. Come to the station in the evening, and bring the money.}}  Initially, Glukharyov was suspected of killing her. The investigation had a version that he had been a member of a criminal group but decided to cut off ties with the criminal world, and they had decided to intimidate him. It was impossible to identify the victim, as she was left without eyes. With the permission of the [[Moldavian SSR]], the head of the murdered Trasyn was shown on television. After that, police was called by 7-year-old Viktor Trasyn, the son of the deceased. He recognized his mother, whom he had not seen in a week. As he was left an orphan, the boy was put in an orphanage.

Soon after, Skrynnik killed a new victim named Anastasia Mikhailova, bringing to Glukharyov her severed hand. The examination later established that the head and the hand belonged to different people. Different theories began to appear: some claimed that there were necromancer-sorcerers in Kishinev, digging up corpses from the graves, while others claimed that a maniac who had operated in the USSR at the time, [[Nikolai Dzhumagaliev]], had reached the Moldovan capital. A note had been placed yet again in the hand of the victim:{{Cquote
| quote = Fedor, you still do not want to play? You do not believe that we are not afraid of blood? Then kiss the female hand. In three days you will bring money to the station. Otherwise, we will chop your daughter into pieces.}} After reading the letter, operatives decided to put guards on watch for Oksana, Glukharyov's daughter. Once Skrynnik, who was among the suspects, went into the Glukharyovs' house courtyard, the plain-clothed operatives tried to detain him, but Oksana told them: "Let Uncle Sasha go, he is good." The decided to organize a meeting between Glukharyov and the alleged gangsters - the possible murderers. Under the guise of railway workers at the [[Chișinău railway station|Kishinev station]], they set up an ambush. Glukharyov arrived at the station, but one came to him.

While investigating the case, Anatoly Magdalyuk, senior investigator for particularly important cases under the Prosecutor's Office of the Moldavian SSR, drew attention to an interesting fact: Glukharyov preferred that people not call him Feodosiy, but Fedor - a name only relatives and good friends called him. From this followed the conclusion that the murder was committed by a person who knows Glukharyov very well. His second cousin, Dmitry Kozintsev, a restaurant owner to whom Glukharyov took his bride on the wedding, came into view. A scandal broke out, with Kozintsev threatening to kill Glukharyov, but the matter was hushed up. Once at the station, an undercover operative called Dmitry Kozintsev by name and surname, upon which he tried to flee, but stumbled and was quickly detained. However, it turned out that Kozintsev was only involved in the embezzlement of socialist property, which he had been long suspected of.

Not long after, Skrynnik attack another girl, Olga Lebedeva, in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of Lenin Komsomol. He tried to rape and kill her, but the victim managed to escape and call for help. She said that the offender shouted at her: "I will cut you into pieces, creature". These words caused the investigators to go investigate the park, where they found the headless body of Trasyn. Lebedeva said that she had seen her attacker's face, and it was a man she had seen previously after the announcement. He had come to see her, but quickly left and then attacked her (so he attacked her again this time). She had kept the letters from him, the author of which turned out to be Skrynnik. However, it wasn't possible to compare the handwritings of the killer and Glukharyov, as the notes the maniac sent were written in block letters. Skrynnik was then summoned to the military registration and enlistment office, where he was required to fill out documents in block letters, and they coincided with the handwritings of the killer.

=== Arrest, trial ===
Alexander Skrynnik was detained at the "Patria" cinema, where he had gone with a girl. He admitted his crimes without any repentance, calling himself an "orderly of nature". At his trial, he stated that he would describe all the terrible things he had done and asked for those with a weak stomach to leave. The Supreme Court of the Moldavian SSR sentenced Skrynnik to death, and he was subsequently [[executed by firing squad]], but the exact date is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.sputnik.md/incidents/20171217/16170175/manjak-serijnyj-ubijca-prestuplenie.html|title=Сексуальные маньяки и серийные убийцы в Молдове|date=2017-12-17|publisher=[[Sputnik|Sputnik Молдова]]|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magdalena Solís''', also known as the '''High Priestess of Blood''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/H/HERNANDEZ_cayetano_santos_SOLIS_magdalena.php Crimezzz index] accessed July 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[serial killer]] and member of a [[Mexico|Mexican]] cult responsible for orchestrating several murders which involved the drinking of the victims' blood.&lt;ref name="TrueTv's Crime Library"&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/4.html TrueTv's Crime Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019130348/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/4.html |date=2013-10-19 }} accessed July 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She was convicted of two of the murders and sentenced to 50 years in prison.

==Life==
Magdalena Solís came from a poverty-stricken dysfunctional family, and entered into [[prostitution]] at a young age&amp;mdash;an occupation in which she worked until she became involved with the Hernandez Brothers in 1963. Her brother, Eleazar Solís, acted as her [[pimp]] during this time.

==The Hernandez Brothers' cult==
In late 1962 and early 1963, brothers Santos and Cayetano Hernandez, a pair of petty criminals, reached the small town of Yerba Buena, a small community near the city of [[Ciudad Victoria]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. As part of a [[scam]], the brothers told the impoverished and mostly illiterate villagers that they were prophets of the "powerful and exiled [[Inca]] gods."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The brothers demanded worship and tribute from the villagers in exchange for treasures hidden in the caves of the mountains surrounding the village.

Many of the inhabitants of Yerba Buena believed the brothers' claims of being Inca prophets, thus the brothers founded a relatively prosperous sect. In nearby caves, where Inca treasures were allegedly hidden, the brothers organized drug-fueled [[orgy|orgies]] and treated many villagers, both men and women, as [[sex slave|sex slaves]]. However, the villagers began to grow impatient at not seeing their promised treasure.

Faced with possible exposure, the Hernandez brothers traveled to [[Monterrey]] in search of prostitutes who would take part in the farce. They eventually found Solís and her brother, who traveled back to Yerba Buena with them. During one of the cave rituals, using a [[smoke screen]], the brothers introduced Solís as the reincarnation of an Inca goddess. Solís developed a severe [[religious delusion]] and took over the sect. Under her leadership, the rituals became more grisly and perverse as Solís became enamored of [[vampire lifestyle|consuming blood]] and [[sadomasochism]].

==Crimes==
By the time Solís took over the cult, two members who had grown tired of the sexual abuse expressed a desire to leave the group. They were brought before Solís, who demanded that they be put to death. The two members were [[lynching|lynched]] by the terrified adherents.

After these first two murders, Solís' [[pathology]] evolved. Instead of simple orgies, she began to demand [[human sacrifice]]s. She devised a "blood ritual" in which the sacrificed (typically a dissenter) was brutally beaten, burned, cut and maimed by all the members of the cult. Thereafter, blood-letting was practiced. The blood was deposited in a cup mixed with chicken blood, after which the victim was made to bleed to death. [[Animal sacrifice]]s and the use of [[marijuana]] and [[peyote]] were also practiced in these rituals.

Solís drank from the chalice and had it passed around, first to the "high priests" &amp;mdash; the Hernandez Brothers and Eleazar Solís &amp;mdash; and finally the other members. The belief, based on elements of [[Aztec mythology]], was that this gave them supernatural powers{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Solís, supposedly the [[reincarnation]] of the Aztec goddess [[Coatlicue]], claimed that she needed to drink blood to stay young forever.

The murders continued for six weeks in 1963, claiming four lives. By the time the final sacrifices took place, they reached the point of [[vivisect]]ing the hearts of the victims.

In May 1963, a fourteen-year-old local resident named Sebastian Guerrero wandered near the caves where Solis' cult was performing their rites. Attracted by the lights and noises coming out of one of the caves, he witnessed one of the rites in progress. Guerrero ran over 25&amp;nbsp;km, from Yerba Buena to the nearest police station in the town of [[Villagrán, Tamaulipas|Villa Gran]]. The next morning, an investigator named Luis Martinez escorted Guerrero back to Yerba Buena. Guerrero took Martinez into the mountains to show him where he had seen the "[[vampire]]s." Guerrero and Martinez were never seen alive again.

==Arrest and sentencing==
The police were initially skeptical of the cult claims, but became suspicious following the disappearances of Guerrero and Martinez. On May 31, 1963, policemen and soldiers from Ciudad Victoria were deployed to Yerba Buena. Magdalena and Eleazar Solís were arrested on a farm in the town, in possession of a considerable amount of [[marijuana]]. Santos Hernandez was shot by police while resisting arrest; his brother Cayetano was assassinated by one of the members of the sect, Jesus Rubio, who had previously wanted to gain the same rank as the high priests for protection.

In subsequent investigations, authorities found the mutilated bodies of Guerrero and Martinez near the farm where the Solís siblings were arrested. They then found the bodies, also [[dismemberment|dismembered]], of the other six victims in the vicinity of the caves.

Magdalena and Eleazar Solís were each sentenced to fifty years in prison for the killings of Guerrero and Martinez. Authorities were unable to confirm their participation in the other six murders because all the cult members who were arrested refused to testify.

Many members of the cult were shot in a shootout with the police after barricading themselves in the caves. Those who were arrested were sentenced to thirty years in prison for six counts of murder in the form of "group or gang murder, or lynching." Their illiterate and pauperised condition served as mitigating factors. It was not until years later that some ex-cult members spoke about their experiences.

'''Abdul Latif Sharif''', first name also spelled '''Abdel''' (September 19, 1947 &amp;ndash; June 1, 2006), was an Egyptian-born American [[chemistry|chemist]] and chief suspect in the [[Deaths in Ciudad Juárez|Juárez killings]], a decade-long murder spree that began in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Ciudad Juárez]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/61426.html|title=Egyptian charged of feminicide death in Chihuahua|author=Carlos Coria Rivas and Carlos Lui C.

==Background==
===Childhood and youth===
Sharif was born into a Muslim family in Egypt as an only child. Growing up he suffered constant sexual abuse from his father and several male relatives.&lt;ref name=juarez&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.periodistasenlinea.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=76|title=Endless doubt after Sharif's death|author=Tony Diaz|publisher=periodistasenlinea.org|date=2012|accessdate=11 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his father was opposed to him attending school, Sharif showed signs of above-average intelligence, spending his time training carrier pigeons and fishing in the river. At age 12, at his father's behest, he agreed to marry to his 10-year-old cousin, but three years later Sharif abandoned that promise to instead travel to the [[United States]]. His family disapproved and his aunt allegedly cast a spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVMsAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;dq=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eICuT_z5MuLy2QWLkJHqCA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ|title=Bones in the desert|author=Sergio Rodríguez González|accessdate=12 May 2012|page=334|location=Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, Sharif studied chemical engineering at Cairo University, where he achieved an average of 9.9. Working as a high school and university instructor, he spent some time in the [[Soviet Union]] before traveling to [[New York (state)|New York]] to find work in cosmetics, paint, and skin-care companies. He was considered to be professional, attractive, and successful. Women became his obsession during his 21-year stay in the United States. He married twice and had five other partners with whom he lived for long periods.

===Arrival and life in America===
Sharif emigrated legally to the United States in 1970, arriving in New York, where he began a job at which he remained employed eight years until being fired in 1978 because of his alcohol problems. He then moved to [[Pennsylvania]], where he resided for three years. In 1981 he moved to [[Florida]], where he was employed in the company Cercoa, Inc. During this time, he committed his first sexual assaults; in 1982, he got married but they quickly divorced as a result of his violence toward his wife.&lt;ref name=ciudad/&gt; He remained a prominent chemist, and during a stay in Mexico he kept patents on various petrochemical processes he had invented.&lt;ref name=abdul&gt;{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgJhFnnvGzYC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=abdel+latif+sharif&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eICuT_z5MuLy2QWLkJHqCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=abdel%20latif%20sharif&amp;f=false|title=Governance in crisis: crime, conflict and violence in Latin America|author=Erick Lopez Tagle Gomez|publisher=Books in network|edition=1|pages=179-800|accessdate=12 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
===Imputation for sexual abuse===
According to official accounts, Sharif was a promiscuous alcoholic and pedophile. He allegedly tortured dying animals during his hunting expeditions and collected girls' clothes. According to other sources, this characterization of Sharif was an invention of the prosecution to make credible accusations against him.

Sharif's first alleged sexual assault took place on 2 May 1981 in [[North Palm Beach, Florida]], where he tricked a woman by promising her a job as a housekeeper. He kidnapped the woman, beat her, and sexually assaulted her. Afterwards he let the woman go, with the woman claiming that he said:
{{cquote|quote="Oh, did I hurt you? I think you should go to a hospital."|source=Abdul Latif Sharif towards the woman.&lt;ref name=ciudad/&gt;}}

Sharif's defence was provided by Cercoa, Inc. Though Sharif argued that the sex was consensual, he was convicted on charges of assault, rape, and illegal deprivation of liberty, and was released on [[parole]].

Almost immediately after leaving prison, in August 1981, he assaulted another woman. On this occasion he was sentenced to 45 days in prison after a defense once again financed by Cercoa, Inc.&lt;ref name=juarez/&gt; Curiously, Sharif was not dismissed until 1982.

In 1982, after his dismissal, he moved to [[Gainesville, Florida]], where he married. This wife also soon divorced him after he had beaten her to unconsciousness. On 17 March 1983, Sharif's third rape was reported. He again used the deception of a job as a housekeeper, luring a woman to his house. He hit, raped, and threatened her, but she managed to escape and report him. This time, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, in 1984.

After spending only 5 years in prison, Sharif was released in 1989, but he was not deported to Egypt even though the judge had ruled that this would be the case. That year he moved to [[Midland, Texas]], where he was hired by the transnational company Benchmark Research and Technology. In 1991 he was arrested for drunk driving but was again not deported. In 1993 he allegedly raped a woman again, and his defense was sponsored by Benchmark Research and Technology. He was released on parole with the promise that he would never set foot on American soil again.

On 14 May 1994, Sharif moved to Ciudad Juárez, still technically working as a Benchmark employee.

The incidents in which he was involved in the U.S. were the following:
* Joanne Collins Poldesmink (3 March 1981 in North Palm Beach, Florida)
Joanne was Sharif's girlfriend, towards whom he was allegedly verbally abusive. Collins filed legal charges against Sharif, which she later dropped.
* Janet Stroven, sexual assault
Sharif met this woman in a hotel bar where he attended a chemist convention. Stroven would later file sexual assault charges against Sharif.
* Molly Fleming, sexual assault (2 May 1981)
Sharif was accused by his neighbor Molly Fleming of drugging and sexually assaulting her. He was given 5 years of conditional release.
* Susan Wait, sexual assault
Wait was a university student who lived in Sharif's house. She accused him of assault and the police arrested him for this and for transferring his parole from a previous incident. He was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison, of which he served 5 years and 4 months. While imprisoned he taught chemistry to his fellow inmates.
* Nancy Díaz, sexual assault (Midland, Texas)
Díaz accused Sharif of sexual assault, but the charges were eventually dropped.

Due to these five incidents, Sharif was deported from the United States.

===Murders===
Sharif's first alleged murder occurred in Mexico in March 1995, but there were indications that he was a scapegoat of the Chihuahua Attorney General's Office, who made him into a serial killer. It was claimed that he could have begun killing from 1978 to 1981 while still residing in Pennsylvania, when the unsolved disappearances of several women and girls occurred. However, Sharif was never connected to these events.

Upon his arrival in Mexico in 1994, Sharif settled in the luxurious and exclusive Rinconadas de San Marcos neighbourhood of Ciudad Juárez, with all the expenses sponsored by the company he worked for. Sharif distinguished himself as an intelligent man, patenting 25 chemical formulas. It was here that his prolific career as a serial killer allegedly lasted from 1994 to 1995.

==Detention, trial and conviction==
On 3 October 1995, Sharif was reported by a prostitute, 19-year-old Blanca Estela Díaz, as having kidnapped her for three days, during which she was beaten, raped, and threatened with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last1=Rodríguez|first1=Teresa|last2=Montané|first2=Diana|last3=Pulitzer|first3=Lisa|title=The Daughters of Juárez (Daughters of Juárez): An authentic story of serial murders south of the border|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z39kasUZ_YkC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=sergio+armendariz+diaz+ciudad+juarez&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V0jnUJz1Oc2A2AXz_IG4BQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sergio%20armendariz%20diaz%20ciudad%20juarez&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2013|language=Spanish|edition=1.ª|year=2007|publisher=Simons &amp; Schuster, Inc.|location=New York, United States|isbn=978-0-7432-9302-0|chapter=3. The mutilator of Juárez|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dismissed on the grounds that, contrary to her claims, there were no signs of sexual abuse. However, the Chihuahua government was being pressured to find the perpetrator of the Ciudad Juárez femicides in Lote Bravo and Sharif, with his criminal background, was the ideal candidate to be the serial killer. The Chihuahua Attorney General's Office sought to establish him as responsible for the multiple homicides.

Within 20 minutes of his release, Sharif was remanded for the disappearance of Elizabeth Castro García, a 17-year-old girl with whom Sharif allegedly had a relationship. Elizabeth's sister, Eunice, had reported her disappearance on 15 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=The deaths of Ciudad Juárez: the case of Elizabeth Castro García and Abdul Latif Sharif|author=Gregorio Ortega|publisher=Fontamara Series|page=143|date=1999|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpse of a woman who matched Castro's description was found buried in the desert of Lote Bravo, but the investigation took a turn when it was found that Elizabeth Castro was alive and that the body was that of a woman who disappeared in March 1995, Silvia Rivera Salas. According to witnesses, Silvia had been kidnapped by two suspects in a van.

Sharif was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison for the death of Silvia Rivera Salas. A new criminal proceeding was also opened, accusing him of murdering 17 other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://asesinosenseriebios.blogspot.mx/2009/09/el-depredador-de-ciudad-juarez-mexico.html|title="The Predator of Ciudad Juárez" (Mexico)|accessdate=4 January 2013|last=Rivera|first=Horacio B.|date=29 September 2009|newspaper=Encyclopedia of serial killers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was in prison, corpses of raped and strangled women continued to appear in different areas of Ciudad Juárez. The authorities sold an image of Sharif to the press portraying him as the psychopathic rapist killer who controlled the murders from prison.

==Controversy==
===Scapegoat===
Sharif was known in Ciudad Juárez as a sexual criminal with a long history of assaulting women, and it was not difficult for all to believe that he was responsible for the murders. In addition to the prosecution and the Chiahuahuan government, the people believed that one person could be put in place as the sole perpetrator. This claim calmed the families of the murdered and not the national, but the international press that had its sights on Ciudad Juárez - Sharif did not speak Spanish, was a foreigner, without family and with a history of sexual assaults; he was the right person to point as the killer. One day, however, Sharif summoned the media to give a press conference in which he would say the names of the real murderers of the women found dead in Lote Bravo. Under pressure from the press and because of his scarce Spanish, names like and [[Alejandro Máynez|Alejandro]] and Melchor Máynez came to light. Alejandro had come to fall in love with a dark, thin and humble girl, and he, as he was known through Juárez, was the adopted son of a prominent Juárez businessman who owned gambling houses, bars and leisure spots on the border with [[El Paso, Texas]]. After Alejandro murdered the girl, Sharif claimed to have met him in a bar where he had boasted about raped and murdered the girls with the help of his cousin Melchor. The authorities inquired about that information because he knew that Maynez's father had paid them off so his son could enjoy total immunity. It indeed had happened, because Alejandro was never questioned or bothered to give his version of the facts regarding what was said by Sharif. Sharif began to hold constant press conferences, a situation that was deemed inconvenient by the High commanders of the Attorney General's Office in Chiahuahua, so they transferred him to the Chihuahua prison as a highly dangerous prisoner. They denied him the right to see his defense attorney many times with any kind of pretext. Meanwhile, the situation in Juárez worsened, because even with Sharif in jail, bodies of raped and strangled young girls under the same modus operandi continued to appear.

Irene Blancas, defense attorney for Sharif, pointed out that she suffered constant threats inside the prison, that the story about him was absurd, and even the same judge who had sentenced him to 60 years, in a personal conversation with the defender of Sharif, admitted to not having enough evidence to convict him. However, the same judge knew that he would not be released, that Sharif would die in prison in strange circumstances, with the authorities later revealing that he had died of a heart attack.

===New Crimes===
Between October 1995 and April 1996, while Sharif was already imprisoned, a further 12 feminicides were registered in the city. In 1995, a group of serial killers who acted in a group, [[The Ciudad Juárez Rebels]], were arrested and charged with murdering 17 women.

That same year, another serial killer group, [[The Ruteros of Ciudad Juárez]], were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|first=Villalpando Moreno|last=Rubén|title=Someone very powerful, with police protection, after the impunity of feminicides of Ciudad Juárez: experts and activists|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2002/11/04/articulos/51_juarez.htm|publisher=La Jornada|accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authorities, all of them were hired by Sharif  to commit the murders and thus divert the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141646/http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731|url=http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731|title=The dead ones of Juárez of Victor Ronquillo: the morbid of the cynical reason|author=José Manuel García-García|publisher=Al Margen|date=23 March 2005|archivedate=6 October 2014|accessdate=2 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Sharif faced 17 charges of aggravated material homicide, 24 counts of intellectual homicide, dozens of charges for kidnapping and rape, and charges of organized crime and illegal human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127101929/http://contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2010/10/17/feminicidios-en-juarez-policias-fabrican-culpables/|url=http://contralinea.info/archivo-revista/index.php/2010/10/17/feminicidios-en-juarez-policias-fabrican-culpables/|title=Feminicides in Juárez:police fabricate guilt|author=Santiago Santorum Gallur|publisher=Contralínea 204|date=7 October 2010|archive-date=27 January 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Abdul Latif Sharif died on June 2, 2006, at the age of 59, in the Social Rehabilitation Center of Chihuahua, from a cardiact arrest consistent with a hypovolemic shock generated by a chronic hemorrhage due to [[peptic ulcer disease]]. Since 2003, he had been diagnosed with [[liver cirrhosis]] subsequent to [[hepatitis C]] and [[alcoholic hepatitis]], and a major depressive disorder, at least according to authorities.

He was buried in Mexico, as no relative could be found to repatriate his remains. His funeral was attended by the Egyptian consul in Mexico, Karim El Sadat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/353176.html|title=They buried the feminicides in Ciudad Juárez|author=Carlos Coria Rivas|publisher=The Universal Chihuahua|date=3 July 2006|accessdate=12 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he was innocent until his death.

Ever since Sharif's death to this day the murders continue, with the same modus operandi with which they had started, and women continue to disappear since 1993.

'''Roberto Succo''' (April 3, 1962 in [[Mestre]] – May 23, 1988 in [[Vicenza]]) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[serial killer]] who committed several murders and other violent crimes mostly in Italy and France in the 1980s.

==Murders==
Succo was born in [[Mestre]]. On 9 April 1981 he fatally stabbed his mother Maria 32 times, and his father, a [[Polizia di Stato|police officer]], who had refused to lend him their car. He hid their bodies in the bathtub covered in water and lime to delay the discovery of the murders and fled with his father's [[Beretta 92|service pistol]].

He then fled from Mestre,&lt;ref name=Succo&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/03/01/assassino-per-sei-volte-si-uccidere.html|title=Six-time assassin "Yes, I like killing"|publisher=La Repubblica|date=1 March 1988|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an investigation into the murders of the Succo couple immediately connected them to the son, who was arrested two days later at the exit of a pizzeria in [[San Pietro al Natisone]], not far from the border with [[Yugoslavia]], after he had briefly returned to the crime scene.

After Succo was caught, he was judged [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and sentenced to ten years in a [[psychiatric imprisonment|psychiatric prison]] in [[Reggio Emilia]]. While serving his sentence, he  was a model prisoner who studied [[geology]] at the [[University of Parma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=nIHYDa9VeD0C&amp;pg=PT88&amp;dq=roberto+succo+g%C3%A9ologie&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj20PG47bzYAhXBWxQKHeI4D5wQuwUIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=roberto%20succo%20g%C3%A9ologie&amp;f=false|title=Les tueurs en série|last=Vergès|first=Jean-Pierre|date=26 September 2007|publisher=Hachette Pratique|isbn=9782012301573|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After serving five years of his sentence, on May 15, 1986 while on freedom privileges, Succo escaped from the psychiatric hospital. He evaded police and escaped to [[France]] by rail, using fake documents and changing his surname to "Kurt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.gazzettino.it/nordest/venezia/succo_il_killer_dagli_occhi_di_ghiaccio_che_terrorizz_mestre_e_la_francia/notizie/316351.shtml|title=Succo, the ice-eyed killer terrified Mestre and France|publisher=Il Gazzettino|date=18 August 2003|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years, he committed numerous crimes, including [[burglary]], [[rape]] and murder. In France, he killed two women, a physician, and two [[National Police (France)|police officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/informations/la-cavale-de-roberto-succo_722204.html|title=La cavale de Roberto Succo|last=Pelletier|first=Eric|date=3 April 2008|work=L'Express |access-date=2 January 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/02/12/un-italiano-il-ricercato-in.html ''The Italian is sought fter N.1 in France'', La Repubblica, February 12, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; He [[kidnapping|kidnapped]], [[Carjacking|hijacked]], and terrorized people in three European countries.

After being recognized by a student in [[Aix-les-Bains]] on April 6, Succo returned to Italy. On 28 February 1988 he was caught in [[Mestre]],&lt;ref name=Succo/&gt; his hometown. On March 1, 1988, in the course of an escape attempt, he fell from the roof of the [[Treviso]] prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/03/02/ultima-impresa-di-rambo-killer.html ''The last venture of the Rambo-killer'', La Repubblica, March 2, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

He committed [[suicide]] in his cell in [[Vicenza]], in the "San Pius X" prison on May 23, 1988, suffocating himself with a plastic bag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/05/24/meglio-morto-che-prigioniero.html ''Better dead than a prisoner'', La Repubblica, May 24, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Bernard-Marie Koltès]] wrote a play (''Roberto Zucco''){{efn|Koltès changed the spelling of his title character's name, as some early newspaper accounts had misspelled it, to underscore his lack of interest in "representational validity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Crime and Media in Contemporary France| first=Deborah Streifford|last= Reisinger| pages=65, 84|date=2007| publisher =Purdue University Press| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e23ZrdFFUqYC&amp;pg=PA84&amp; |access-date= 23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} loosely based on Succo's life and crimes.

'''Gianfranco Stevanin''' (born October 2, 1960), known as the '''"Monster of Terrazzo"''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and [[serial killer]], convicted of murdering six women between 1993 and 1994. His case had great prominence in the national media and raised a debate on the question of incapability of criminals understanding the consequences of their acts.

== Capture ==
On November 16, 1994, in [[Vicenza]], Stevanin picked up a prostitute named Gabriele Musger in his [[Volvo 240]], offering her money to have sex and take pictures of her. After several hours of extreme sexual games, the prostitute tried to escape through the window of a bathroom and later refused to take other pictures, resulting in being threatened with a knife by Stevanin. To save her life, she offered Gianfranco all her savings (about 25 million [[Italian lira|lires]]) if he let her go,&lt;ref name=Gian&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/11/21/tracce-di-due-scomparse-nella-casa-degli.html Traces of two disappears in the house of horrors] Repubblica.it&lt;/ref&gt; and the maniac accepted; however, the money was at Musger's house and then the two got into his car to go get it. At toll booth at Vicenza, Stevanin stopped to pay the toll, and at that moment the prostitute managed to get out of the car, go to a police car and report her client for sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/16/mi-uso-come-una-schiava-sono.html 'Used' As a Slave, Saved by Money] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; The police arrested him for sexual assault, extortion, and possession of a toy gun without the regular red cap. Following this event, he was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120714201900/http://quotidianonet.ilsole24ore.com/2000/12/23/1635059-Stevanin-ferito-alla-gola-nel-manicomio-criminale.shtml Stevanin wounded in the throat in the criminal asylum. The farmer in the 'casolare degli horrors', accused of having slaughtered six women, was attacked by an immigrant inmate]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==
During searches of his house, investigators found prohibited pornographic material (including over 7000 photographs personally taken by Stevanin and his partners), anatomy books, boxes containing pubic hair and a file containing information on all his partners.&lt;ref name=Gian/&gt; Although the police consider Stevanin the only one in the group who violated and attempted extortion, investigators began to suspect more serious crimes after finding objects belonging to a woman named Biljana Pavlovic, whom has been missing since August 1994, and Claudia Pulejo.&lt;ref name=Gian/&gt; The two girls were also mentioned in Stevanin's files. The man justified himself by saying that he had short relationships with them and that the clothes were just a token of love that the girls had left him.

On July 3, 1995, a farmer from [[Terrazzo, Veneto|Terrazzo]] found a sack containing the remains of a corpse in a plot near Stevanin's house. Gianfranco became a murder suspect, and the magistrate sent some bulldozers to look for other bodies.

On November 12, 1995, the body of another woman was found; this time the body was also found in a sack,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/17/un-sacco-di-plastica-trovata-la-traccia.html A Plastic Bag Found The Trace That Leads To Assassin] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; but on this occasion the discovery took place in a land owned by Stevanin, with the DNA test unequivocally showing that the body was that of Biljana Pavlovic. On December 1, 1995, a third body was found, that of Claudia Pulejo.&lt;ref name=broke&gt;[https://archive.today/20120715063449/http://archivio.lastampa.it/LaStampaArchivio/main/History/tmpl_viewObj.jsp?objid=1500195] Archive of lastampa.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevanin was questioned by the investigators but his attitude was controversial: at times he seemed to remember something, and then denied it immediately, claiming that he had an empty memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/11/15/signor-giudice-parlero.html Signor Giudice, Parlero] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; Other murders attributed to him include the murder of [[Austria]]n prostitute Roswita Adlassnig, who had been missing for a few months and present both in Stevanin's photos and his files, and another murder of an unidentified woman with whom he evidently engaged in a sexual act with while she was dead.

In September 24, 1996 (after the partial confession of Stevanin), another unidentified body was found in the [[Adige]]. After a DNA test, the body was recognized as that of Blazenca Smolijo.

== Confessions ==
On July 19, 1996, Stevanin decided to confess and claimed to have dismembered the bodies of four women,&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; but that their murders weren't premeditated, as they had died during extreme sexual relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1996/08/25/sono-morte-dopo-un-gioco-di.html 'I Am Death After a Sex Game'] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of Pulejo, due a [[heroin]] [[overdose]].&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; Regarding the unidentified corpse, he stated that she was a student whose name and face he did not remember, saying he had met her only three or four times. Stevanin later claimed that he acted without knowing what he was doing, as if his actions were just dreams.

== Trial ==
After several sessions of psychiatric examinations, Stevanin was declared processable and able to understand the consequences of his actions, with the experts saying that he was mentally capable, intelligent (with an IQ of 114) and a skilled computist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1996/novembre/05/Mostro_Terrazzo_Stevanin_capace_intendere_co_0_9611058850.shtml The Monster of Terrazzo. "Stevanin able to understand and want"]&lt;/ref&gt; The defense experts tried to challenge the psychiatric report, stating that all the disturbances of Gianfranco Stevanin are due to a previous motorcycle accident that almost cost him his life.

Stevanin showed at the sessions with a shaved head, to show well the evident scar that according to the defense is at the base of everything. The first sentence by the Court of Assizes of Verona, on January 29, 1998, condemned Gianfranco Stevanin to [[life imprisonment]], of which 3 years in total daytime isolation.

In January 1999, Stevanin sold his house and all the land he owned to partially compensate the families of the victims.&lt;ref name=broke/&gt; On July 7, the Appellate Court of Venice absolved the accused of murder charges because he was incapable of understanding his actions and resentenced him to 10.5 years for concealment and mutilation of a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/luglio/08/Stevanin_assolto_manicomio_co_0_9907085948.shtml Stevanin acquitted: goes to the asylum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/stefi/stefi/stefi.html?ref=search The killer Stevanin sentenced to 10 years] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the Court of Cassation of [[Rome]] then canceled the sentence by "illogical motivation", referring to a new section of appeal reviewing of the case. In December 2000, while he was locked up in a mental asylum, Stevanin was seriously injured in the neck with a razor bite inflicted by another non-European prisoner.&lt;ref name=broke/&gt;

The final sentence was announced on March 23, 2001: the Appellate Court of Venice declared that Gianfranco Stevanin was capable of understanding his crimes, which is why his sentence was automatically confirmed to life imprisonment. The Court of Cassation confirmed the sentence, rejecting the defense's demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=17906 Rainews24]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is still{{As of when?|date=January 2019}} imprisoned in the [[Sulmona]] prison in [[Abruzzo]], where he saved the life of a cellmate who tried to commit suicide twice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/08/19/stevanin-svento-tentato-suicidio.html Stevanin foiled attempted suicide] Repubblica.it.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2010, he told the press that he did not remember anything about his murders and also affirmed his desire to become a [[Franciscan]] lay brother because of his mother's death, thus emulating another case that occurred seventy years ago, when [[Alessandro Serenelli]], murderer of [[Maria Goretti]], also became a Franciscan while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/verona/notizie/cronaca/2010/1-settembre-2010/serial-killer-prostitute-si-fa-frate-1703677512710.shtml The serial killer of prostitutes wants to become a lay brother]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad Suradji''' (12 December 1952 – 10 July 2008), also known as '''Nasib Kelewang''' and '''Datuk Maringgi''', was an [[Indonesia]]n [[serial killer]] who admitted to murdering 42 girls and women between 1986 and 1997. Suradji's victims, ranging in age between 11 and 30, were strangled after being buried in the ground up to their waists as part of a [[ritual]].&lt;ref name=documentary&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmad Suradji: Indonesia's Sorcerer From Hell|publisher=[[Mediacorp Channel 5]]|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He buried his victims in a [[sugarcane]] plantation near his home, with their heads facing his house, which he believed would give him extra power.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/indonesia/2286216/Black-Magic-Killer-executed-for-42-murders.html|title=Black Magic Killer executed for 42 murders|date=11 July 2008|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ahmad Suradji lived in [[Medan]], the capital of [[Indonesia]]'s [[North Sumatra]] province. He worked as a cattle-breeder and as a ''[[dukun]]'', a class of [[shaman]] reputed to possess supernatural powers. Suradji's clientele were often women seeking his guidance on how to find good fortune or maintain their beauty. According to Suradji, his deceased father visited him in a dream in 1986 and commanded him to murder 70 women as part of a [[black magic]] ritual.

==Death==
His three wives, who were sisters, were also arrested for assisting in the murders and helping him hide the bodies. One of his wives, Tumini, was tried as his accomplice and was sentenced to death before it was reduced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1034352/Sorcerer-killed-42-women-girls-enhance-magical-powers.html|title=Shaman murdered 42 women and girls in a bid to enhance his magical powers|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=11 July 2008|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He was sentenced to death by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] and executed on 10 July 2008.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;

==Murders==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
On 24 April 1997, 21-year-old Sri Kemala Dewi asked a 15-year-old [[rickshaw]] puller named Andreas to take her to "Datuk". She informed him to keep it a secret and never requested to be picked up.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Three days later, Dewi's naked and decomposing body was found in a sugarcane field by a man and was later dug up by a group of people who then called the police.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Andreas reported to the police and Dewi's family that he had dropped her off at Suradji's house three days earlier, and so police visited Suradji for confrontation.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Although he denied any links with Dewi's killing, police found Dewi's handbag, dress and bracelet in his home. He was later arrested on 30 April 1997.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; During interrogation, Suradji slowly confessed to Dewi's murder but also revealed that he had killed up to 42 girls in the same fashion and an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] process had to be carried out in the sugarcane field where Dewi's body was located.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Throughout the process, 42 bodies had been found with some being so decomposed to the point where they were unidentifiable.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;

He told police that he had a dream in 1986 in which his father's ghost directed him to drink the saliva of 70 dead young women so that he could become a mystic healer.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji thought that it would take him too long to encounter 70 dead women singly and so he took up the initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; As a [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]], or [[dukun]], women came to him for spiritual advice for such things like making themselves more beautiful or richer or so Suradji could cast a spell on their spouses so they'll never have an affair.&lt;ref name=wife.sentenced/&gt;&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; He would take them into a sugarcane field and bury them up to their waist, claiming it was part of the ritual.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; He would then strangle them until they were dead and proceed to drink their saliva. After, he would strip the clothes from their bodies to accelerate decomposition and bury them back into the ground with their heads pointing toward his house.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt; Suradji stated the following to the police:

{{quote|My father did not specifically advise me to kill people. So I was thinking, it would take ages if I have to wait to get seventy women. I was trying to get to it as fast as possible, I took my own initiative to kill.&lt;ref name=documentary/&gt;}}

'''Charles Sobhraj''' (born 6 April 1944), is a [[France|French]] [[thief]], [[fraud]]ster and [[serial killer]] of [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Indian people|Indian]] origin who preyed on Western tourists, primarily [[beatniks]], throughout the [[Hippie Trail]] of [[Southeast Asia]] during the 1970s. He was best known as '''the Bikini Killer''' due to the attire of his victims, as well as '''the Splitting Killer''' and '''the Serpent''', due to his skill at deception and evasion. Sobhraj allegedly committed at least a dozen murders and was convicted and jailed in [[India]] from 1976 to 1997. After his release, he retired as a celebrity in [[Paris]]. Sobhraj later returned to [[Nepal]] in 2003, where he was arrested,  tried, and received a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/sobhraj-finally-convicted-life-sentenced-79.html|title=Sobhraj finally Convicted &amp; Life-sentenced|accessdate=30 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625033251/http://ekendraonline.com/nepal/sobhraj-finally-convicted-life-sentenced-79.html|archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj is widely believed to be a [[psychopath]]. He had an intense hatred of [[hippies]], and many of his murders reflected this. He was described as devilishly handsome, and did not refrain from using his attractiveness to his advantage in his criminal career. This, as well as his cunning and cultured personality, ensured his celebrity status long before his release from prison. He enjoyed his fame, charging large sums for interviews and film rights. He has been the subject of four biographies, three documentaries and a [[Bollywood]] movie titled ''[[Main Aur Charles]]''. Sobhraj's return to Nepal, where he was still eagerly sought by authorities, is thought to be the result of his yearning for attention and overconfidence in his own intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bikini Killer|url=http://www.asian-news-channel.tv/index.php/entertainment/67-bollywood/6120-the-bikini-killer|accessdate=23 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104742/http://www.asian-news-channel.tv/index.php/entertainment/67-bollywood/6120-the-bikini-killer|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Charles Sobhraj was born as '''Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj''' to [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] shop girl Tran Loang Phun, and [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] businessman Sobhraj Hatchand Bhaonani, who was based in [[Saigon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEAZl6QOyK0|title=SOBHRAJ – Or How To Be Friends With A Serial Killer (FULL FEATURE)|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://puzzups.com/bikini-killer-charles-sobhraj-complete-life-story-where-is-he-now/|title=Bikini killer Charles Sobhraj and his complete life story! Where is he now?|accessdate= 6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were divorced and his father deserted the family. [[Stateless person|Stateless]] at first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomvater.com/charles.html|title=Charles Sobhraj profile|accessdate=23 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130014448/http://tomvater.com/charles.html|archivedate=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sobhraj was adopted by his mother's new boyfriend, a [[French Army]] lieutenant stationed in [[French Indochina]]. There he was [[child neglect|neglected]] in favour of the couple's later children. However, Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]] and [[France]] with the family. As a teenager, he began to commit petty crimes and received his first jail sentence (for [[burglary]]) in 1963, serving time at [[Poissy]] prison near [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.za/famous_criminal/93/the_crimes/1/Charles_Sobhraj_The_Serpent.htm|title=Charles Sobhraj: The Serpent – Famous Criminal – The Crimes|accessdate=27 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009013306/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.za/famous_criminal/93/the_crimes/1/Charles_Sobhraj_The_Serpent.htm|archive-date=9 October 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While imprisoned, Sobhraj eagerly manipulated prison officials into granting him special favours, such as being allowed to keep books in his cell. Around the same time, he met and endeared himself to Felix d'Escogne, a wealthy young man and prison volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/charles_sobraj/4.html Profile], trutv.com; accessed 1 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

After being paroled, Sobhraj moved in with d'Escogne and shared his time between moving between the high society of Paris and the criminal underworld. He began accumulating riches through a series of burglaries and [[scam]]s. During this time, Sobhraj met and began a passionate relationship with Chantal Compagnon, a young Parisian woman from a conservative family. Sobhraj proposed marriage to Compagnon, but was arrested later the same day for attempting to [[resisting arrest|evade police]] while driving a [[motor vehicle theft|stolen vehicle]]. He was sentenced to eight months in prison, yet Chantal remained supportive throughout the entirety of his sentence. Sobhraj and Chantal were wed upon his release.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/12-things-you-didn%E2%80%99t-know-about-the-infamous-charles-sobhraj-233025.html|title=12 Things You Didn't Know About The Infamous Charles Sobhraj|work=indiatimes.com|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj, along with a pregnant Chantal, left France in 1970 for [[Asia]] to escape arrest. After traveling through [[Eastern Europe]] with fake documents, robbing tourists whom they befriended along the way, Sobhraj arrived in [[Mumbai]] later the same year. Here, Chantal gave birth to a baby girl, Usha. In the meantime, Sobhraj resumed his criminal lifestyle, running a car theft and [[smuggling]] operation. Sobhraj's growing profits went towards his budding [[gambling addiction]].&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;

In 1973, Sobhraj was arrested and imprisoned after an unsuccessful [[armed robbery]] attempt on a jewellery store at Hotel Ashoka. Sobhraj was able to escape, with Chantal's help, due to faking illness, but was re-captured shortly thereafter. Sobhraj borrowed money for [[bail]] from his father, and soon after fled to [[Kabul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/charles-sobhraj-the-serpent/crime Sobhraj profile], crimeandinvestigation.co.uk; accessed 1 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There, the couple begun to rob tourists on the [[Hippie Trail]], only to be arrested once again. Again, Sobhraj escaped in the same way he had in India; feigning illness and drugging the hospital guard. Sobhraj then fled to [[Iran]], leaving his family behind. Chantal, although still loyal to Sobhraj, but wishing to leave their criminal past behind, returned to France and vowed never to see him again.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/its-a-secret-0000450-v21n9|title=It's a Secret: My Time with Charles Sobhraj, the Bikini Killer|author=Gary Indiana|work=VICE|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj spent the next two years on the run, using as many as ten [[identity theft|stolen passports]]. He passed through various countries in Eastern Europe and the [[Middle East]]. Sobhraj was joined by his younger half-brother, André, in [[Istanbul]]. Sobhraj and André quickly became partners in crime, participating in various criminal activities in both [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]]. The duo were eventually arrested in [[Athens]]. After an identity-switch hoax went awry, Sobhraj managed to escape, but his half-brother was left behind. André was turned over to the Turkish police by Greek authorities and served an 18-year sentence.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/764804/charles-sobhraj-hated-india-but-the-country-got-to-him-in-the-end|title=Charles Sobhraj hated India, but the country got to him in the end|author=Nandini Ramnath|work=Scroll.in|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
On the run again, Sobhraj financed his lifestyle by posing as either a [[gemstone|gem]] salesman or [[drug dealing|drug dealer]] to impress and befriend tourists, whom he then [[fraud|defrauded]]. In [[Thailand]], Sobhraj met [[:W:Fr:Marie-Andrée Leclerc|Marie-Andrée Leclerc]] (1945–1984) from [[Lévis, Quebec|Lévis]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], a tourist looking for adventure. Dominated by Sobhraj, she quickly became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women.

Sobhraj gathered followers by gaining their loyalty: a typical scam was to help his target out of difficult situations. In one case, he helped two former French policemen, Yannick and Jacques, recover missing passports that Sobhraj himself had actually stolen. In another scheme, Sobhraj provided shelter to a Frenchman, Dominique Rennelleau, who appeared to be suffering from [[dysentery]]; Sobhraj had actually [[poison]]ed Rennelleau. He was finally joined by a young Indian man, Ajay Chowdhury, a fellow criminal who became Sobhraj's second-in-command.&lt;ref name=ajay1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/charles_sobraj/11.html|title=Charles Sobhraj - Crime Library on truTV.com|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ajay2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stararticle.com/article_112081_Hunt-still-on-for-Sobhrajs-partner-in-crime.html|title=Hunt still on for Sobhraj's partner in crime|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj and Chowdhury committed their first (known) murders in 1975. Most of the victims had spent some time with the duo before their deaths and were, according to investigators, recruited by Sobhraj and Chowdhury to join the pair in their crimes. Sobhraj claimed that most of his murders were really accidental [[drug overdose]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65vK_gbsgwI}}&lt;/ref&gt; but investigators state that the victims had threatened to expose Sobhraj, which was his motive for murder. The first victim was a young woman from [[Seattle]]. Teresa Knowlton (named Jennie Bollivar in the book ''Serpentine'') was found drowned in a tidal pool in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], wearing a flowered [[bikini]]. It was only months later that Knowlton's [[autopsy]], as well as [[forensic science|forensic evidence]], proved that her drowning, originally believed to be a swimming accident,&lt;ref name=natgeovid&gt;{{cite web|last=Cissel|first=Jim|title=Charles Sobhraj – The Serpent (Serial Killer Documentary)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNAsPISleMM|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was murder.

The next victim was a young [[nomad]]ic [[Sephardic Jew]], Vitali Hakim, whose burnt body was found on the road to the [[Pattaya]] resort, where Sobhraj and his growing clan were staying. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] students Henk Bintanja, 29, and his fiancée Cornelia Hemker, 25, were invited to Thailand after meeting Sobhraj in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="mammoth"/&gt; They, like many others, were poisoned by Sobhraj, who then nurtured them back to health in order to gain their obedience. As they recovered, Sobhraj was visited by his previous victim Hakim's French girlfriend, Charmayne Carrou, who had come to investigate her boyfriend's disappearance. Fearing exposure, Sobhraj and Chowdhury quickly hustled the couple out. Their bodies were found [[strangulation|strangled]] and burned on 16 December 1975. Soon after, Carrou was found drowned and wearing a similar-styled swimsuit to that of Sobhraj's earlier victim, Teresa Knowlton. Although the murders of both women were not connected by investigations at the time, they would later earn Sobhraj the nickname "The Bikini Killer."&lt;ref name="mammoth"/&gt;

On 18 December, the day the bodies of Bintanja and Hemker were identified, Sobhraj and Leclerc entered [[Nepal]] using the deceased pair's passports. They met in Nepal and, on 21–22 December, murdered Laurent Carrière, 26 (from Canada), and Connie Bronzich, 29 (from the [[United States|U.S.]]); the two victims were incorrectly identified in some sources as Laddie DuParr and Annabella Tremont. Sobhraj and Leclerc returned to Thailand, using their latest victims' passports before their bodies could be identified. Upon his return to Thailand, Sobhraj discovered that his three French companions had started to suspect him of serial murder, having found documents belonging to the murder victims. Sobhraj's former companions then fled to Paris after notifying local authorities.&lt;ref name="mammoth"&gt;''The Mammoth Book of Gangs'', Mammoth Books, Running Press (26 June 2012); {{ISBN|0762444363}}/{{ISBN|978-0762444366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobhraj's next destination was either [[Varanasi]] or [[Calcutta]], where he murdered [[Israel]]i scholar Avoni Jacob simply to obtain Jacob's passport. Sobhraj used the passport to travel with Leclerc and Chowdhury – first to [[Singapore]], then to India, and, in March 1976, returning to [[Bangkok]], despite knowing that the authorities there sought him. The clan was interrogated by Thai policemen in connection with the murders, but released because authorities feared that the negative publicity accompanying a murder trial would harm the country's tourist industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Meanwhile, Dutch [[diplomat]] Herman Knippenberg was investigating the murders of Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met, Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With the help of a neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. He was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was [[Malaysia]], where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving [[Malaysia]] to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="ajay1"/&gt; A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in [[West Germany]], but the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.&lt;ref name="ajay2"/&gt;

Soon back in Asia, Sobhraj started to build a new criminal "family," starting with two lost Western women, Barbara Smith and Mary Ellen Eather, in [[Bombay]]. Sobhraj's next victim was a Frenchman, Jean-Luc Solomon, whose poisoning during a robbery, simply intended to incapacitate him, left him dead.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In July 1976 in [[New Delhi]], Sobhraj, joined by his three-woman criminal clan, tricked a tour group of French [[post-graduate]] students into accepting them as tour guides. Sobhraj then drugged them by giving them poisoned pills, which he told them were anti-dysentery medicine. When the drugs took effect more quickly than Sobhraj had anticipated, the students began to fall unconscious. Three of the students realized what Sobhraj had done. They overpowered him and contacted the police, leading to his capture. During interrogation, Sobhraj's accomplices, Smith and Eather, quickly buckled and confessed. Sobhraj was charged with the murder of Solomon, and all four were sent to [[Tihar Jail|Tihar prison]], New Delhi while awaiting formal trial.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Prison time==
Smith and Eather attempted suicide in prison during the two years before their trial. Sobhraj had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in [[bribery|bribing]] captors and living comfortably in jail. He turned his trial into a spectacle, hiring and firing lawyers at whim, bringing in his recently [[parole]]d brother André to assist, and eventually going on a [[hunger strike]]. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Leclerc was found guilty of drugging the French students, but was later paroled and returned to Canada when she developed [[ovarian cancer]]. She was still claiming her innocence and was reportedly still loyal to Sobhraj when she died at her home in April 1984.&lt;!-- age?? --&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

Sobhraj's systematic bribery of prison guards at Tihar reached outrageous levels. He led a life of luxury inside the jail, with television and gourmet food, having befriended both guards and prisoners. He gave interviews to Western authors and journalists, such as ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine's [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]] in the late 1970s, and Alan Dawson in 1984. He freely talked about his murders, while never actually admitting to them, and pretended that his actions were in retaliation against "Western [[imperialism]]" in Asia.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

When Sobhraj's sentence was to end, the twenty-year Thai arrest [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] against him would still have been valid, thereby affecting his [[extradition]] and almost certain [[Execution (legal)|execution]]. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, Sobhraj threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills and walked out of the jail. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in [[Goa]]; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against him long lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.&lt;ref name="indiatimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nandiniramnath"/&gt;

==Celebrity and re-capture==
Sobhraj retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris. He hired a publicity agent and charged large sums of money for interviews and photographs. He is said to have charged over $US15 million (according to advocate and former police inspector Bishwa Lal Shrestha, who investigated the case, framed the charge sheet and registered the case in court) for the rights to a movie based on his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3867791.stm|title=The 'bikini-killer' linked to murders throughout Asia|accessdate=27 September 2009|work=BBC News|date=12 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2003, Sobhraj was seen in a street of [[Kathmandu]] by a journalist. The journalist quickly reported this to the Nepalese authorities, who arrested him two days later in the [[casino]] of the Yak and Yeti hotel. Sobhraj's motives for returning to Nepal remain unknown. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] by the Kathmandu district court on 20 August 2004 for the murders of Bronzich and Carrière in 1975. Most of the photocopy evidence used against him in this case was from that gathered by Knippenberg, the Dutch diplomat, and [[Interpol]]. He appealed against the [[conviction (law)|conviction]], claiming that he was sentenced without trial. His lawyer also announced that Chantal, Sobhraj's wife in France, was filing a case before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] against the [[Government of France|French government]] for refusing to provide him with any assistance. Sobhraj's conviction was confirmed by the Patan [[Court of Appeals]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Current status==
In late 2007, news media reported that Sobhraj's lawyer had appealed to the then [[President of France|French president]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], for intervention with Nepal. In 2008, Sobhraj announced his engagement to a Nepali woman Nihita Biswas (who later participated in the reality show ''[[Bigg Boss]]''). On 7 July 2008, issuing a press release through his fiancée Nihita, he claimed that he was never convicted of murder by any court and asked the media not to refer to him as a [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2008/07/id/2845|title=Press Release of Charles Shobhraj|publisher=Mysansar|accessdate=28 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724043528/http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2008/07/id/2845|archive-date=24 July 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was claimed that Sobhraj married his fiancée on 9 October 2008 in jail on [[Dashain#Dashami|Bada Dashami]], a Nepalese festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Charles_Sobhraj_weds_Nepalese_girlfriend/rssarticleshow/3577773.cms|title=Charles Sobhraj ties the knot with Nihita Biswas|publisher=The Times of India|date=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, Nepalese jail authorities dismissed the claim of his marriage. They said that Nihita and her family had been allowed to conduct a [[Tilaka|tika]] ceremony, along with the relatives of hundreds of other prisoners. They further claimed that it was not a wedding but part of the ongoing [[Dashain]] festival, when elders put the [[Bindi (decoration)|vermilion mark]] on the foreheads of those younger to them to signify their blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-10-10/rest-of-world/27934181_1_charles-sobhraj-kathmandu-s-central-jail-bikini-killer|title=Sobhraj wedding a farce: Nepal jail authorities|publisher=The Times of India|date=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] postponed the verdict on an appeal filed by Sobhraj against a district court's verdict sentencing him to life imprisonment for the murder of American backpacker Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. Sobhraj had appealed against the district court's verdict in 2006, calling it unfair and accusing the judges of racism while handing out the sentence.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On 30 July 2010 the Supreme Court upheld the verdict issued by the district court in Kathmandu of a life sentence for the murder of Connie Jo Bronzich and another year, plus a Rs 2,000 fine for entering Nepal illegally. The seizure of all Sobhraj's properties was also ordered by the court. Sobhraj’s “wife” Nihita and “mother-in-law” Shakuntala Thapa, a lawyer, expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict, with Thapa claiming that Sobhraj had been "denied" justice and that the "judiciary is corrupt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/08/id/12461|title=Video of Shakuntala Thapa claiming "judiciary is corrupt|publisher=Mysansar|access-date=3 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217030945/http://www.mysansar.com/archives/2010/08/id/12461|archive-date=17 December 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged and sent to judicial custody&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=SC+orders+judicial+custody+for+Nihita%2C+Shakuntala&amp;NewsID=252290|title=SC orders judicial custody for Nihita, Shakuntala|publisher=The Himalayan Times|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[contempt of court]] because of these remarks.

On 18 September 2014, Sobhraj was convicted in tBhaktapur district court of the murder of Canadian tourist Laurent Carrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29261120|title=Nepal court convicts 'Bikini killer' Charles Sobhraj of second murder|publisher=BBC News|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received several [[open heart surgery|open heart surgeries]], and is scheduled for more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/special/when-i-kept-charles-sobhraj-alive/20181218.htm|title=Testimony of a Surgeon Operating on Charles Sobhraj|publisher=Rediff News|author=Dr Raamesh Koirala|date=18 December 2018|accessdate= 30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/newstopics/charles-sobhraj.html|title='Bikini Killer' Charles Sobhraj Critical in Hospital, Says Mother-In-Law|publisher=News 18|date=23 June 2017|accessdate=30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darbara Singh''' (1943/1944 or 1952 – 6 June 2018) was an Indian serial killer, who has been convicted for two murders.

During April–October 2004, 23 children of non-[[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] migrants were kidnapped in the [[Jalandhar]] city of [[Punjab, India]]. Many of these children were sexually assaulted, and 17 of them were killed. In October, the police apprehended Darbara Singh, who had earlier been jailed for nearly a decade in another case involving sexual assault and attempted murder on a child. Singh allegedly confessed that he was behind all these abductions, sexual assaults and murders in 2004. He was convicted for two of the murders, and sentenced to life in prison. He was also convicted for two more murders; in this case, he had led the police to dead bodies after his arrest. He was given a death sentence in this case, but was later acquitted by the High Court because of insufficient evidence. He was also acquitted in four more cases because of insufficient evidence. He died in 2018, while serving a life sentence, with some of the cases pending for trial.

== Early life ==

Darbara Singh is a native of Jallupur Khera village of [[Amritsar district]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt; He joined the Indian Armed Forces, and was posted at the Air Force Station at [[Pathankot]]. In 1975, he was accused of lobbing a [[hand grenade]] at the house of his senior officer Major V K Sharma, after having an altercation with him. The wife and teenaged son of the officer were seriously injured in the attack. Singh was dismissed and arrested; however, he was acquitted after a trial.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/print/news/india-s-cruel-serial-baby-killer-darbara-singh-who-murdered-2674-98.html |title=India's cruel serial baby killer Darbara Singh, who murdered 17 babies |publisher=India TV  |date=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh had three children; his wife expelled him from their house, because of his "bad habits".&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

In 1996, Darbara Singh raped and attempted to murder the daughter of a migrant labourer in [[Kapurthala]]. In 1997, he was convicted in three cases of rape and attempt to murder, and sentenced to prison for 30 years. From Kapurthala he was shifted to the Jalandhar Central Jail, and then to the Ludhiana Central Jail. On 3 December 2003, his mercy petition was accepted on the basis of his good conduct, and he was released from the jail. By this time, he had developed a grudge against migrants, holding them responsible for wasting many years of his life.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2008/01/07/death-sentence-to-child-serial-killer-in-punjab-1199776446.html |title=Death sentence to child serial killer in Punjab |date=2008-01-08 |publisher=One India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, he came to Jalandhar, where he started working in a factory in the Leather Complex area. He lived in a rented room in the Model House locality. To take his 'revenge' against the migrants, he started targeting their children.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt;

== Modus operandi ==

Singh lured his victims with [[South Asian sweets|sweets]], [[samosa]]s, [[sugarcane juice]], and crackers. He took them to a secluded place, where he would attack the victim. In most cases, he slit their throat, and attempted to rape their dead bodies. After his arrest, he said that he raped the dead bodies so that "there would be no shrieks of victims".&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

He preferred time to kidnap the children was between 10 am and 12.30 pm, when most of migrant labourers were away in factories.&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

After his arrest, he said that he was not drunk at the time of committing crimes, but afterwards, "celebrated almost each of the killings with liquor and good food".&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

== Alleged victims ==

During  a period of 7 months, 23 children, most of them below the age of 10, went missing from Kapurthala city. Of them, six were recovered by the police. Darbara Singh admitted that he had killed the other 17 victims, including 15 girls and 2 boys. He subjected many of the dead bodies to rape or sodomy.&lt;ref name="OneIndia_death_2008"/&gt; He said that he had dumped most of the bodies near a bridge on the Rayya-Khadoor Sahib road.&lt;ref name="IndiaTV_cruel_2013"/&gt;

Singh targeted children of non-Punjabi migrants. He killed one Punjabi girl by mistake, and after his arrest, said that he had been "shaken" by her death.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

There, he made Asha sit on one side of the canal. He took Diksha behind the bushes, and raped her. A frightened Asha ran away from the place, while Diksha was killed. Meanwhile, when the two girls did not return for a long time, their cousins returned home and informed the family. The family searched for the girls, and then registered a missing persons complaint. Later, a man named Malkiat Singh found Asha in Fazilpur village in Tarn Taran district. He gave her biscuits and medicines, and then brought her to the [[Khadoor Sahib (Lok Sabha constituency)|Khadoor Sahib]] police station. The police control room then informed the Jalandhar police station that a girl named Ashu had been found in Tarn Taran. Later, the police found Diksha's naked dead body lying on a big stone near Bahadurpur Uppal canal. A post-mortem conducted on 21 April revealed that she had died because of "[[neurogenic shock]] as a result of injuries to private part".&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Darbara Singh vs State Of Punjab |court=Punjab and Haryana High Court |date=2013-02-20 |url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143465181/ |accessdate=2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040421/punjab1.htm#23 |title=Missing girl's body found |date=2004-04-21 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police had to declare the body as unclaimed and it was accordingly cremated at Phagwara.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Bipin_2010"/&gt;

== Arrest ==

By September 2004, panic had spread among the local residents. In the preceding 4 months, 14 children had been kidnapped with no ransom demands, and 10 of them were still missing. The chopped arm of a child was found near [[Wariana|Variana]], and the partly decomposed body of a 10-year-old girl was found in [[Chaheru]]. The police were looking for "a middle-aged cycle borne suspect, who is probably mentally challenged".&lt;ref name="Tribune_panic_2004"/&gt;

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) analyzed the killer's modus operandi and prepared his sketch based on information gathered from different sources. On the morning of 29 October 2004, the police received information about a bicyclist, who resembled the sketch and was seen with a bag of toffees. [[Station house officer|SHO]] Pritam Singh was despatched to nab the person, who turned out to be Darbara Singh.&lt;ref name="Tribune_held_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041030/main3.htm |title=Serial baby killer held |date=2008-10-30 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the police party intercepted him near Bastian, Singh threw away his bicycle and tried to run away. The police apprehended them and questioned him, following which he confessed his crimes.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"/&gt;

According to the police, Darbara confessed to having targeted 23 children, out of whom he killed 17. However, the police suspect that the actual number of victims could be more. Their suspicion was based on similar abductions in Kapurthala district and recovery of two more mutilated bodies of babies in jungles of Jallupur Khera village of Amritsar district.&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;

Nishu, who had escaped from his clutches on 22 October, identified him from his pictures in newspapers.&lt;ref name="Tribune_leads_2004"/&gt; Ilaqa Magistrate K.K. Kareer remanded him in 10 days' police custody. After his medical examination and court appearance, Darbara Singh led the police to a place near Kadianwali village. There, the police found bodies of two victims, Khursheed and Ronku, who had been killed on 25 October.&lt;ref name="Tribune_leads_2004"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041031/main5.htm |title=Serial killer leads cops to bodies of 2 victims |date=2004-10-30 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrest, Darbara Singh showed no remorse, even when he was taken to the sites where he had dumped the dead bodies. He told the police that he could have killed more children, if he had not been arrested "so soon". He said that he had no remorse for killing the children of migrant labourers, as they were instrumental in sending him to jail. He also added that he targeted a Punjabi girl by mistake, and had to kill her because "she could have created problems" for him; he said that he was "a bit shaken" by this. He contradicted himself, by first saying, "I still think whatever I did was right and it was the demand of the time", but then adding "I think what was done by me was wrong and I promise that I would never do it again."&lt;ref name="Tribune_devilish_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune_held_2008"/&gt;

== Convictions and acquittals ==

After his arrest, Darbara Singh was charged in 18 cases of abduction, rape and murder. By the end of 2007, he was acquitted in three of these cases due to lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="ToI_nails_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Girls-testimony-nails-baby-killer/articleshow/2984280.cms |title=Girls' testimony nails baby killer |author=IP Singh |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2008, Judge Iqbal Singh Bajwa awarded him death sentence for murders of Khursheed and Ronku in 2004.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Dharm_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080108/main5.htm |title=Death for baby killer |author=Dharmendra Joshi |date=2008-01-08 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January, he was shifted from Jalandhar jail to the Patiala Central Jail for hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080110/punjab1.htm#11 |title=Baby serial killer shifted to Patiala jail |date=2008-01-10 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Varinder Singh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Singh was tried for raping and killing 8-year old Diskha on 18 April 2004. Her sister Asha and her two cousins identified Singh in the court. Singh's counsel claimed that he had been falsely implicated, and based his defence on the premise that the children were tutored witnesses.&lt;ref name="PHHC_943-DB"/&gt; On 25 April 2008, Judge B.K Mehta of Jalandhar court sentenced him to life imprisonment .&lt;ref name="Tribune_Kusum_2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080426/punjab1.htm#20 |title=Serial baby killer gets life term |date=2008-04-26 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Kusum Arora }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2009, Justice Mehtab Singh Gill and Justice Jitendra Chauhan of the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] reversed the death sentence awarded to Darbara Singh for murder of Khursheed and Ronku. Citing insufficient evidence, the Court acquitted Darbara Singh, giving benefit of the doubt.&lt;ref name="IE_moved_2010"/&gt; The prosecution had presented Jathedar Pritam Singh as a witness. Pritam claimed that he had recognized Darbara Singh at a police checkpost on 29 October 2004, leading to the latter's arrest. He also claimed to have seen Darbara Singh taking the two children away from Basti Mithu on a bicycle, on 25 October. Pritam stated that he was going towards Basti Mithu at the time. Once he reached Basti Mithu, he came to know that two children were missing from the area. He then rushed to the place where he had seen Darbara earlier, but did not find him or the children there. Although this incident happened on 25 October 2004, he did not report it to the police until 28 October. This was despite the fact that he was a member of [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali Dal]]'s working committee, and was well-aware of the child abduction incidents happening in the area. The Court, therefore, ruled that him out as a "planted witness". The prosecution had also presented Darbara Singh's fingerprints on a liquor bottle and glass, stating that these had two objects been recovered from the place where the dead bodies were found. In support, the prosecution had presented the testimonies of several policemen and the owner of the field where the bodies had been found. the Court pointed out that there was no mention of these objects in the inquest reports of Khursheed and Ronku. Besides, the police claimed to have recovered these objects on 30 October, but sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory only on 11 November. Therefore, the Court dismissed this piece of evidence, citing a 1997 Supreme Court judgment, which had ruled that the accused is entitled to acquittal if the fingerprints are kept in the police station for more than 5 days. The judge also questioned why the police had not taken any DNA or blood samples. He directed the police to adopt scientific methods instead of relying on "archaic methods of investigation".&lt;ref name="PHHC_138-DB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090731/cth2.htm#8 |title=HC: Shun archaic methods of probe |date=2009-07-31 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Saurabh Malik }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, the Punjab government moved the Supreme Court, calling the High Court's decision as "wholly erroneous".&lt;ref name="IE_moved_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/sc-moved-against-acquittal-of-man-on-death-row/579263/0 |title=SC moved against acquittal of man on death row |newspaper=Indian Express |date=2010-02-13 |author=Raghav Ohri |location=Chandigarh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2010, Judge B S Sandhu acquitted him in Tazbin rape and murder case, because of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Bipin_2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101211/punjab.htm#16 |title='Serial baby killer' acquitted in rape, murder case |author=Bipin Bhardwaj |newspaper=The Tribune |date=2010-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dainiktribuneonline.com/2010/12/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BF/ |title=सबूतों के अभाव में बेबी किलर बरी |newspaper=Dainik Tribune |date=2010-12-11 |language=Hindi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darbara Singh was also convicted for kidnapping and causing life-threatening injury to Nishu. Nishu could not speak because of the throat injury, but she used expressions to identify Darbara Singh as her kidnapper and attacker. Guddi, a neighbour of Nishu, also testified that she had seen Darbara Singh standing with his bicycle in the area where the children were playing. Another man, Sham Lal, testified that he had seen Darbara Singh taking a young girl on the carrier of his bicycle in Isharwal village. Singh appealed against the conviction in the High Court, but his appeal was rejected.&lt;ref name="PHHC_D-11-DB"/&gt;

== Death ==
In 2018, Singh fell ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uniindia.com/~/serial-killer-of-23-children-of-jalandhar-dies-in-patiala-jail/States/news/1256950.html |title=Serial killer of 23 children of Jalandhar dies in Patiala jail |date=10 June 2018 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was moved from the prison to the [[Government Medical College, Patiala|Government Rajindra hospital]] in [[Patiala]] on 2 June. There, he died on 6 June; his family refused to claim his body, calling his crimes "unpardonable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/child-serial-killer-dies-at-75-family-refuses-to-claim-body/articleshow/64533207.cms |title=Child serial killer dies at 75, family refuses to claim body |author=Manish Sirhindi |newspaper=The Times of India |date=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanpatimar Shankariya''' (1952 - 16 May 1979) was an Indian serial killer.

He was born in [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] in 1952 and arrested at the age of 26.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=kampatimar+shankariya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B3BDArYx9I&amp;sig=ACfU3U3O0X2NMwLzbpZUDDdCe2SyDZmsPw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjypSZ_ozmAhXWbSsKHba0Ai04ChDoATAHegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=kampatimar%20shankariya&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|last=Newton|first=Michael|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8160-6987-3|location=|pages=239|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aajtak.intoday.in/crime/story/unknown-facts-about-indian-serial-killer-kampatimar-shankariya-from-rajasthan-1-887624.html|title=हथौड़े मार 70 लोगों की हत्या करने वाले 'कनपटीमार' की खौफनाक दास्तान|date=2016-09-14|website=aajtak.intoday.in|language=hi|access-date=2019-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confessed that he had killed at least 70 people in 1977-1978 for pleasure.

'''Satish''' (born c. 1973) is a convicted Indian pedophile and serial killer who was active in [[Bahadurgarh]] in [[Haryana]] from 1995 to 1998. He admitted kidnapping and attempting to rape fourteen girls, murdering ten. Police confirmed Satish's involvement in twelve cases, including the ten murders. Since his victims were all five to nine years of age, he is also known as the '''Bahadurgarh baby killer.'''

The police's inability to apprehend Satish led to protests and near-riots by local residents. Under pressure, police prosecuted three men in succession as the murders continued. Satish was finally arrested in 1998, when his final victim led police to him. He was convicted of twelve sexual assaults and ten murders, and is serving a life sentence.

== Early life ==

Satish came to Bahadurgarh from [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]] with his parents.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070116/haryana.htm#1 |title=Nithari-like case at Bahadurgarh |date=2007-01-16 |newspaper=The Tribune |author=Yoginder Gupta }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at the home of his father, Brij Pal, in Bahadurgarh's Netaji Nagar section. When Satish was arrested in 1998, he was 25 years old.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

== Victims ==

Police confirmed that Satish was involved in kidnapping and raping (or attempting to rape) twelve young girls, ten of whom he killed:&lt;ref name="Court_2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/636716/ |title=Satish vs The State Of Haryana on 21 January, 2008 |accessdate=2015-07-15 |publisher=Punjab-Haryana High Court }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dalbir Bharti |title=Police And People : Role And Responsibilities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPL8Htpu0m8C&amp;pg=PA204 |year=2006 |publisher=APH Publishing |isbn=978-81-313-0045-9 |pages=204–209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021222/haryana.htm#8 |title=Life term for serial girl killer |date=2002-12-22 |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Chandigarh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Investigations}}Initial suspects ==

=== {{anchor|First false arrest: Raj Kumar}}Raj Kumar ===

Satish's first victim was Pooja, who was killed in February 1995. Since her father was employed by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Union Home Ministry]], the police were under pressure to apprehend the culprit quickly. They arrested Raj Kumar (also known as Raja), saying that he had confessed to the crime. Raja was cleared after being imprisoned for 18 months.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

in July 1995, while Raja was still in police custody, Satish raped and killed a seven-year-old girl. After Satish's third crime in September 1995, the police began looking for a serial killer. When the fourth girl was murdered in October 1995, angry local residents organized [[dharna]]s. Authorities transferred the local police superintendent and intensified patrolling in the area. The police asked parents to keep an eye on their children (especially young girls) and report any suspicious persons, but there was no progress in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Second false arrest: Ram Babu}}Ram Babu ===

In January 1996, Satish kidnapped and raped two girls in five days. Local residents intensified their protests, organizing [[bandh]]s, so the [[deputy inspector general of police]] (DGP) and the district [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]] (SP) remained in Bahadurgarh to supervise the investigation. Police explored the possibility that the killer lived in neighbouring [[Delhi]], and involved the [[Delhi Police]] in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

The Delhi Police arrested the possibly-[[Intellectual disability|intellectually-disabled]] Ram Babu, claiming the {{INR}}50,000 reward announced by the Haryana police for the arrest of the "Bahadurgarh baby killer".&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; Babu, of [[Bihar]], was arrested at a [[dhaba|roadside restaurant]] on the Delhi-Rohtak road near [[Nangloi Jat|Nangloi]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_killed_1998"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug16/haryana.htm#9 |title=Serial killer killed in jail |date=1998-08-16 |newspaper=The Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murders continued, indicating that Babu was not the killer. On 16 August 1998, three months before Satish was caught and after spending thirty months in prison, 32-year-old Ram Babu was killed in prison. Om Prakash, another prisoner in the mental ward, hit him on the head with a brick and killed him.&lt;ref name="Tribune_killed_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IE_jail_1998"&gt;{{cite news |date=1998-08-17 |newspaper=Indian Express |title="Baby killer" murdered in jail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The senior superintendent of police (SSP) who interviewed Ram Babu later said:

{{quote|In his 30s, neither did he appear mentally deranged nor given to perversity. He kept smiling through his "interrogation" and did not admit to remorse, even after "confessing" to having murdered 70 women. But we could not make out whether he was lying. He didn't make any admissions except when given "suggestions". When prompted, he talked with so much ease about how he disposed of the bodies of his victims that one tended to disbelieve him. The peculiar thing about him was that he sang lewd songs. He would talk about sex and the mere mention of a certain film actress would make him blush and indulge in an "expressed gratification" using verbal rhymes and making "appropriate and overt" sexual gestures. We consulted psychiatrists, who rubbished our theory by saying that regular sexual fantasising, in an overt or covert way, does create a kind of catharsis — resulting in the person being less likely to commit sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/inside-the-mind-of-a-serial-killer/20660/0 |title=Inside the mind of a serial killer |date=2007-01-11 |newspaper=Indian Express }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== {{anchor|Third false arrest: Shankar Kumar}}Shankar Kumar ===

On 22 June 1997, Satish killed seven-year-old Manju. On 10 July the police arrested Shankar Kumar of [[Begusarai]] in Bihar, alleging that he had attempted to abduct Aarti (a young girl from Subhash Nagar in Bahadurgarh). According to Senior Superintendent of Police A. S. Chawla, Shankar admitted kidnapping and murdering Manju.&lt;ref name="IE_jail_1998"/&gt;

The arrest was again found premature when Satish raped and murdered nine-year-old Kinty, whose nude body was found on 8 October. Her discovery led to a violent public protest in Bahadurgarh the following day.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; In near-riot conditions, police opened fire on the crowd and two youths were killed. Nearby units of the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] were called in to assist local police,&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; and the case was transferred to the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CID]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; Because of the massive police presence in the city, Satish did not strike again for the next eleven months.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

== Arrest ==

After nearly a year of inactivity, in September 1998 Satish kidnapped a nine-year-old girl from her family's [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] at night. Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Suman Manjari organized a citizens' anti-crime committee to increase awareness and mobilize support for police efforts. She met with the local [[chamber of commerce]], who posted a {{INR}}10,000 reward for helping police catch the killer.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt;

On 18 November, Satish kidnapped six-year-old Somani when she was returning from her father's [[chaiwala|tea stall]]. Manjari supervised the search and the investigation, but could not make any headway.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; Satish raped Somani twice in his home; when she lost consciousness, he assumed she was dead and threw her into a field near his house.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

Two days later, Umid Singh saw Somani weeping in a dry [[flood control channel]] near a bridge. He asked the girl her name and address, but she would only tell him her name. Singh brought her to the Modern Industrial Area police station. The local police, realizing that she was a probable victim of the "baby killer", informed Manjari. Somani told her that she had been kidnapped by a dark-skinned bicyclist with a thin beard, and led police to the house across the train tracks where she was kept overnight.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; Satish's brother told police that he was at work at a tin factory, where he was arrested.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

After the arrest, the Haryana Police asked the Delhi Police to return the reward they had claimed. The Delhi Police returned the money, which was given to Somani.&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt;

== Conviction ==

According to the police, Satish appeared to be a "mentally deranged sex pervert".&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; From 10 to 23 December 1998, he was observed by Dr. Rajiv Gupta at the [[Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[Rohtak]]. Gupta concluded that Satish was not [[Psychosis|psychotic]], but had a "[[neurosis|neurotic]] type of personality". Satish admitted committing 14 crimes, and on 22 December a magistrate determined that his confession was voluntary. Although Satish later [[Recantation|recanted]] his confession, he was convicted on the basis of evidence;&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt; the details he provided of the kidnappings, rapes and murders were corroborated by other evidence.&lt;ref name="Dalbir2006"/&gt; In the Aarti murder case (victim number 11), he was questioned with lie-detection expert Dr. Bibha Rani on 1 December 1998 and his description of the crime matched the existing evidence.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;

Satish was sentenced to life imprisonment; the court did not find his crime the "rarest of the rare", which would have given him a [[death sentence]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_Nithari_2007"/&gt; In 2008, the [[Punjab and Haryana High Court]] rejected the [[government of Haryana]]'s request for a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Serial-killers-life-spared/articleshow/2722792.cms |title=Serial killer's life spared |date=2008-01-23 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled:

{{quote|In the present case, the accused is already in custody for 10 years. The trial court thought it fit not to impose death sentence. The offence committed is very heinous and though, it may be one of the rarest cases, after weighing all the circumstances, taking a 'global' view, we are of the view that extreme penalty of death sentence is not called for. However, while affirming life imprisonment, we direct that the accused will not be released from custody before completion of 20 years of actual sentence.&lt;ref name="Court_2008"/&gt;}}

'''Seema Mohan Gavit''' (born 1975) and her elder sister '''Renuka Kiran Shinde''' (born 1973) were [[India|Indian]] [[Serial killer|serial killers]] convicted of kidnapping and killing five children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/thieves-who-kidnapped-used-and-killed-babies|title=Thieves who kidnapped, used and killed babies|date=18 August 2014|work=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with thirteen cases of kidnapping and nine murders. The sessions court found them guilty of kidnapping and murdering of six children. The [[High Courts of India|High Court]] has given verdict that the prosecution proved five of the cases and confirmed the death sentence.

The [[Supreme Court of India]] rejected their appeal and sentenced them to [[Capital punishment in India|death]]. Their mercy plea to the [[President of India]] was also rejected.

== Modus operandi ==
Around 1990, Renuka was pick pocketing at a temple where she was caught. She had her son along with her at the time and managed to convince the crowd by sentimentalising them, telling them that a lady with a child cannot commit such crimes. Subsequently, Renuka and Seema, along with their mother Anjana, had children accompany them during their crimes. Over 40 children were kidnapped by 1996 and when they were deemed unusable, they were abandoned, injured or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutton |first1=Candace |title=Serial killer sisters Seema Gavit and Renuke Shinmde’s bid to avoid execution |url=https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/serial-killer-sisters-renuke-shinde-and-seema-gavit-who-abducted-and-murdered-children-in-bid-to-avoid-execution-at-the-gallows/news-story/ef93b4b1ccc699db80223bbf0b4018ad |accessdate=11 June 2019 |work=NewsComAu |date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their crime spree begun when Anjana ordered her daughters to kidnap her stepdaughter (her first husband's daughter) Kranti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doval |first1=Nikita |title=The case of the sisters on death row |url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/Xqy5b3m9sluIV1044grKzL/The-case-of-the-sisters-on-death-row.html |accessdate=11 June 2019 |work=Mint |date=2 September 2014 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial sequence ==
* 19 November 1996: Arrested
* 29 June 2001: Sessions court convicts of kidnapping 13 children and killing 6 — Santosh, Anjali, Raja, Shraddha, Gauri, Pankaj.

* 31 August 2006: Supreme Court confirms death sentence.
* 14 August 2014: [[President of India]] rejects mercy petition.

While Anjana died in 1997 in jail, Seema and Renuka  claimed that they did not deserve death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eustachewich |first1=Lia |title=Serial killer sisters say they don’t deserve ‘barbaric’ death penalty |url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/25/serial-killer-sisters-say-they-dont-deserve-barbaric-death-penalty/ |accessdate=11 June 2019 |work=New York Post |date=25 April 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoltán Szabó''' (1968 – December 5, 2016 in [[Szeged]]), known as the '''Balástya Monster''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[serial killer]] who killed women for monetary purposes. He was convicted of killing four people out of his 5 confirmed murders, but could possibly have upwards of 6 victims.

== Early life ==
Szabó was born into a farmer's family in 1968, and had lived on a farm since his youth. He studied until the eight grade in elementary school, refusing to study any more. His father died early, and his brother who lived on the farm committed suicide. Szabó has already had a criminal record at the time of the murders, as he was convicted for the rape of a 60-year-old woman. He also behaved violently with his partner, who broke the relationship with him because of this. He then began living alone on his farm as a farmer and doing occasional farm work. In addition to this, he also participated in organizing seasonal workers from Romania during the agricultural season, finding work and accommodation for them. During the second half of the 1990s, the traffic near [[Balástya]] grew, as the civil war in [[Yugoslavia]] had recently ended and many passed through the 5th Highway along the settlement. The increasing turnover of the highway attracted businesses, criminals, merchants and prostitutes to the settlement, including some of Szabó's future victims.

== Confirmed murders ==
Szabó's first proven murder was of a woman working in a bar, with whom he met on April 28, 1998. He managed to persuade her to stay on his farm on the outskirts of Balástya. Upon their arrival, the woman was hit with a heavy object several times, dying from the severe head injuries. Szabó then dismembered his victim and buried her body in a pit 50 meters away from the farm, in which he also placed her clothes. The second murder took place in a similar fashion. Szabó met another woman whom he persuaded to come to his farm. When she came, he hit her with heavy object on the head and neck, with the woman dying from the heavy blows. The body was then dismembered and placed in the same pit as before, the only difference being that the second victim's head was never discovered.

In February 2000, on the pretext of joint theft of fire syringes, Szabó lured and killed Teresia K. The woman was strangled in an orchard, and was then mutilated and burned. Her clothes were never found either.

The fourt proven murder led to Szabó's downfall. In August 2001, he convinced a female dealer who used to sell cell phones that she would get a large amount of phones at a favorable price. The woman believed him, and on August 25 she collected 300,000 [[forint]]s from the bank. The woman then drove to Szabó's farm, where she was strangled by him not far from the place. The murderer then disposed of the evidence and the woman's small motorbike in a nearby water hole. However, the authorities were closely monitoring the disappearances, and when the phone dealer disappeared, they searched through her call lists, where they found Zoltán Szabó's number. When questioned, he confessed to the murder. Later on, when more corpses were discovered, he confessed to these murders as well.

== Unconfirmed murders ==
On August 25, 1998, Szabó supposedly forced prostitute Mónika K. to leave the 5th Highway car park and go to his farm. There, he strangled her in a nearby orchard and dragged the body to a track near the [[Cegléd-Szeged railway]] line. Subsequently, a [[freight train]] and two other trains ran over the body, completely crushing it. Although Szabó was last seen in her company, the court could not definitely prove that he was the culprit, and he was not convicted of Mónika K.'s murder.

Szabó also mentioned a sixth murder, which he claimed to have not committed but simply knew of. The investigators doubted his claim of innocence, but the post-mortum investigation proved ineffective, and so this case was included in the indictment.

The police investigator who headed the investigation also stated that he was certain Szabó was responsible for more murders. The detective, referring to a witness' testimony, wrote that Szabó was responsible for the disappearances of a Romanian family of five. He was so confident of his opinion that he offered 500,000 forints to Szabó for each new corpse he showed the location to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20051205milliokat.html|title=The case of the Balástya murders was reopened|publisher=Origo|date=5 December 2005|accessdate=2 October 2015|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation, trial and prison ==
After Szabó's capture, extensive research began for the killer's victims. Following his testimony, the surrounding area was searched, and in the specified places, excavations of an unprecedentead scale, almost of landscaping, began. During the search, four corpses from Szabó's testimonies were located, but no remnants of other murders were found. Despite this, the prosecution suspected him of murdering five women.

Soulakiotis was alleged to have committed her crimes in the Peukovounogiatrissas Monastery ({{Lang-el|Μονή Παναγίας Πευκοβουνογιατρίσσης|links=no}}) near [[Keratea]], Greece. As of 2008, the monastery remains open and still has members who believe she was innocent and venerate her as a saint.

==Religious life==
Soulakiotis was an avid [[Old Calendarist]] and a follower of the Matthewite sect, which the mainstream [[Greek Orthodox Church]] considers to be in schism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omhksea.org/2012/06/old-calendar-new-calendar-the-facts/|title=Old Calendar-New Calendar: the facts|last=Yannakopoulos|first=Joel|date=2012-06-05|website=[[Eastern Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, together with Archbishop and [[hieromonk]] Matthew (Karpathakis) of Besthena, founded the monastery in 1927. After the death of Abp. Matthew, Soulakiotis succeeded him as abbot.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Crime==
Soulakiotis' alleged ''[[modus operandi]]'' was to encourage wealthy women to join the convent, and then torture them until they donated their fortunes to the monastery;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; once the money was donated, Soulakiotis would embezzle it and in some cases kill the donor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[Reuters]]'' reported that at the time of her arrest she had amassed three hundred properties across Greece this way along with "gold and jewels worth thousands of pounds."&lt;ref name="MBulletin" /&gt;

Soulakiotis also demanded strict adherence to [[ascetic practices]] among those in the convent, which police alleged led to the unnecessary deaths of 150 children from tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsbeast.gr/weekend/arthro/2562960/to-kolastirio-tis-monis-kerateas-ke-i-emostagis-igoumeni|title=Το κολαστήριο της Μονής Κερατέας και η αιμοσταγής ηγουμένη|date=2017-02-05|website=Newsbeast.gr|language=el|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims of Soulakiotis' administration of the monastery also variously accuse her of torturing them, starving them, falsely imprisoning them, and beating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scottnevinssuicide.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/the-monastery-of-the-dead-excerpts-from-the-newspaper-freedom-%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-1950s/|title=The Monastery of the Dead (Excerpts from the newspaper "Freedom" (Ελευθερία), 1950s)|last=Nevins|first=Scott|date=2014-12-06|website=Scott Nevins Memorial|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406180024/https://scottnevinssuicide.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/the-monastery-of-the-dead-excerpts-from-the-newspaper-freedom-%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B1-1950s/|archive-date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_xTZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%CE%95%CE%9A%CE%9A%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%A3%CE%99%CE%91+%CE%9A%CE%91%CE%99+%CE%9A%CE%A1%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A3+1833&amp;dq=%CE%95%CE%9A%CE%9A%CE%9B%CE%97%CE%A3%CE%99%CE%91+%CE%9A%CE%91%CE%99+%CE%9A%CE%A1%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A3+1833&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihruTy0-_hAhUPFogKHeYxAaAQ6AEIMTAB|title=Εκκλησία και κράτος 1833 - 1997|last=Karagiannēs|first=Giōrgos|date=1997|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=106–107|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soulakiotis denied all the charges against her until she died, terming them {{Lang|el|«κατασκευάσματα του σατανά»}} ("Satanic fictions").&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The number of Soulakiotis' victims is a matter of some debate; the most commonly cited figure of 27 murders and 150 negligent homicides by neglect comes from medical testimony during her trial.&lt;ref name="MBulletin" /&gt;

'''Alfredo Stranieri''' (born 30 July 1956 in [[Italy]], [[naturalized]] in 1982), known as the "'''Classified Ads Killer'''", is an Italian-born [[France|French]] criminal and [[serial killer]], who met his victims through [[classified ads]] in which he presented himself as a potential buyer of properties or used cars.

He would kill his victims and appropriate their property. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] together with a minimum sentence of 22 years on 28 February 2003 for four murders and one unsuccessful attempted murder. Stranieri had appropriated the property of the two couples he had murdered to use it in fraudulent activities, also trying to kill a man who wanted to sell him a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].

== Crimes ==

=== First double murder ===
Near the end of 1997, Stranieri responded to an ad published by a couple of restaurateurs, Frédéric Adman and his companion Nathalie Girard, who wanted to a nightclub in [[Viry-Châtillon]] called the ''New Love''. On 7 November 1997 the sale was signed, and six days later, the couple disappeared.&lt;ref name="Pradel"&gt;[[:fr:Jacques Pradel|Jacques Pradel]], « Alfredo Stranieri, le tueur aux petites annonces », émission ''L'heure du crime'' sur RTL, 16 janvier 2013{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted murder ===
On 4 January 1999 Stranieri, under the [[pseudonym]] of his first murder victim Frédéric Adman, contacted Simon Cohen through an advertisement for his Jaguar. Curiously, without seeing the vehicle or negotiating about its price, Stranieri offered Cohen to finalize the transaction in his restaurant/nightclub ''New Lover ''in Viry-Châtillon. When Cohen arrived, Stranieri told him that a friend would come and bring him the check certified by the bank to pay for the car. He then coaxed his victim by offering to visit the premises while waiting for the check, to which Cohen reluctantly agreed.&lt;ref name="Michel"&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 years of Criminal Affairs|author=Pascal Michel|date=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stranieri then pulled out a .[[22 LR]] Carbine and, in the dim light, fired 5 times at Cohen, but the man managed to escape to the neighbor's house by climbing the fence. The neighbor then called the police, while Stranieri fled. Simon Cohen was transported to the emergency and rescued after 4 hours of surgery.

The police opened an investigation into the nightclub's owner and discovered that Alfredo Stranieri already had a criminal record for scams and car trafficking. They then went to his home in [[Soisy-sur-Seine]], where his wife Anne-Marie expected that her husband would arrive early, but never did, and the police lost his trail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scenedecrime.blogs.com/scenedecrime/2007/10/laffaire-alfred.html L'affaire Alfredo Stranieri 17 octobre 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaguar case, told in just a few lines at a local newspaper, drew the attention of the Girard couple, whose daughter Nathaliem and her companion Frédéric Adman had disappeared suddenly on 10 November 1997. They were running a restaurant called ''Oasis ''in Viry-Châtillon, which had since became ''New Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/1999/07/21/quatre-cadavres-avec-preuves-d-achat-ce-sont-les-ex-proprietaires-des-commerces-rachetes-par-stranie_279306|title=Four corpses with proof of purchase. These are the former owners of the shops bought by Stranieri|author=Olivier Bertrand|publisher=liberation.fr|date=21 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second double murder ===
In March 1999, in [[Aveyron]], he selected a classified ad for an inn in [[Naussac, Aveyron|Naussac]] called ''La Bouriatte. ''The place was to his taste: luxurious and isolated, and the bill was signed on 10 April 1999. Two days later, Nicole Rousseau and Claude Mouly, the two owners who were in the process of a divorce, disappeared. Alfredo, who introduced himself under the name of Mario Stranieri (thanks to the identity card of his brother, which he had borrowed) and claimed to be the manager of a large nightclub in the [[Paris]] area, accepted the purchase for 4 million francs without negotiating and moved to Bouriatte, while Rousseau and Mouly mysteriously disappeared.

== Arrest and incarceration ==
Corinne Mouly, worried about not hearing from her father, moved in front of the hostel to spy on Stranieri and alerted the [[gendarmes]]. The investigators, under the direction of the commander of the gendarmes in Aveyron, Colonel Gery Plane, then discovered that Stranieri was wanted for the attempted murder of Simon Cohen. "Mario" Stranieri was arrested on 7 July 1999 by the gendarmes in [[Capdenac]].&lt;ref name="Michel"/&gt; The case was entrusted to the Évry research brigade and teams were deployed to search for the bodies of the deceased in Naussac. On 19 July 1999 the police exhumed the bodies of Girard and Adman in the garden of the ''New Love ''nightclub and on the next day, the gendarmes exhumed those of Rousseau and Mouly near ''La Bouriatte''.&lt;ref name="Dejean"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/02/17/191050-alfredo-stranieri-est-il-un-serial-killer.html|title=Alfredo Stranieri, is he a serial killer?|author=Marc Dejean|publisher=[[La Dépêche du Midi]]|date=17 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspected of being an accomplice in his scams, Stranieri's wife Anne-Marie was incarcerated in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1999/12/24/232974-est-elle-complice-d-alfredo.html|title=Is she an accomplice of Alfredo?

== Trial and sentence ==
Alfredo Stranieri's trial began in the [[assize court]] of [[Essonne]] on 18 February 2003. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on 28 February 2003, with a 22-year security sentence. The conviction was confirmed in March 2004 by the [[Créteil]] Court of Appeals. Stranieri's appeal in 2005 was rejected by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/societe/586187-Societe-Retour-sur-une-affaire-criminelle-2-5-Alfredo-Stranieri-le-coucou.php|title=Back on the criminal case: Alfredo Stranieri, "the Cuckoo"|publisher=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]]|date=26 July 2010|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421122427/http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/586187-Societe-Retour-sur-une-affaire-criminelle-2-5-Alfredo-Stranieri-le-coucou.php|archive-date=21 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in prison ==
Alfredo Stranieri and Germain Gaiffe both appeared before the 6th Criminal Chamber in [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] on 11 March 2011 for "disrespect". For months, Stranieri claimed to be the father of the daughter of the former Minister of Justice, [[Rachida Dati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/article/685204/societe-les-deux-assassins-revaient-amant-dati-vont-etre-juges|title=The two murderers who dreamed of being Dati's lover will be judged|publisher=[[20 minutes (France)|20 minutes]]|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This case dates back to September 2010. Stranieri, sentenced to life imprisonment for killing and burying four people in gardens, and Germain Gaiffe, sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for killing and dismembering a man, both posted an identical letter from the [[Poissy]] prison, addressed to the hall of the [[16th arrondissement of Paris]]. Both claimed to the father of Rachida Dati's daughter and enclosed a declaration of paternity. Warned by the prison services, the public prosecutor's office decided to seize the case and prosecute them for "insulting the person in charge of public authority". Dati soon became a civil party. At a hearing, Gaiffe wore a provocative sweater on which "I am the father of Zohra" was written. When questioned, the two men explained that they had shared a moment of intimacy in a room with the minister who came to visit their prison in December 2007, more than a year before she gave birth.

On 17 July 2013 Stranieri married Gaiffe. The wedding, delivered by Frédérik Bernard, mayor of Poissy, took place in the presence of their respective witnesses, the terrorist [[Carlos the Jackal]] and the comedian [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]] at the Central House of Poissy in [[Yvelines]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.20minutes.fr/article/1189551/ynews1189551 "Dieudonné and the terrorist Carlos witness the marriage of two detainees], ''20 Minutes'', 17 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dieudonné had met the two criminals in the prison workshop while writing sketches. ''[[Libération]] ''commented that it is "unlikely that is a marriage of love", and saw it rather as a "new provocation of the comedian, organized with some comrades".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/07/17/mariage-homosexuel-en-prison-avec-carlos-et-dieudonne-pour-temoins_9189688|title=In prison, gay marriage mocked|publisher=[[Libération]]|date=17 July 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nadir Sedrati '''(born 1938) nicknamed "The Cutter of the Canal", is a [[France|French]] [[serial killer]] born to [[Algeria]]n parents. He was sentenced for the murders of three people committed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1817/articles/a22711-sedrati_le_voleur_de_vies.html "Sedrati the thief of lives"] Article of September 2, 1999 published in [//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Nouvel_Observateur Le Nouvel Observateur] number 1817.&lt;/ref&gt; The various pieces of two bodies (the third body was never found) were thrown into the [[Marne-Rhine Canal]] near [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. In his judicial career, he was involved in five disappearances and sentenced for three murders.

== Facts and the investigation ==

=== The first body ===
In May 1999 a fisherman discovered a human right foot in the [[Canal de jonction de Nancy]]. He immediately informed the river police, who at first thought that the foot had been severed by a boat propeller. The next day, a putrefied human head was retrieved 500 meters away from the spot where the foot had been discovered.

A few days later bones, a [[sternum]], ribs and a third patella (that is to say, there was a second victim) that were fished in the vicinity of the canal. The next day a hand was discovered near the Nancy canal; finally, one week after the  discovery (the right human foot), the left foot was retrieved by the River Police. The medical examiner responsible for collecting the various pieces of the human body found that the limbs were sectioned surgically and excluded the hypothesis of an accident: it was therefore a homicide.

The police could not take fingerprint from the found hand because it was too badly decomposed. The River Brigade Police sent their hand to be analyzed in [[Paris]] where the only section of research are able to solve this type of problem. A few weeks later the laboratory managed to put a name to the found hand: Hans Gassen, a [[Germany|German]] who had served a prison sentence and who had been released a few months previously.

Police learned that Gassen was living in the house of another German who was also a former prisoner named Hans Muller. Muller had reported Gassen's disappearance on May 21, 1999, one week before the discovery of the dismembered body in the canal.

At the same time, the police learned that Gassen received a lot of phone calls from two locations: a house in Nancy and an apartment near Nancy. During a search of both places the authorities discovered that a certain Philippe Grossiord regularly called Gassen and that Grossiord was an alias used by a man called Nadir Sedrati to avoid apprehension. Nadir Sedrati was known to the police since he had been arrested for fraud and identity theft and had shared a cell with Gassen and Muller. Sedrati was released from prison in March 1999, after both him and Gassen were both arrested for a confrontation. Muller declared that Hans Gassen left his home at 4 AM because he had an appointment on May 21. Gassen had to call back, but he never did. The phone calls proved that Muller was at home at the time of the disappearance of his friend, clearing him as a suspect. As for Sedrati, he said that it was Muller who killed Gassen during a dispute that went wrong: he declared that Muller, Gassen, two Dutchmen and two Moroccans were at home to discuss business (a supposed trafficking) and that he had left because that affair did not concern him; he then supposedly heard Gassen and Muller argue violently and saw Muller kill Gassen.

French and German police did not believe him and searched Sedrati's house. In his apartment they discovered a [[woodchipper]], a kitchen knife, a butcher's saw and several brownish spots on the floor, the sink and woodchipper. The police thought it was blood but had no proof of it. And by digging deeper into the apartment they realized that a bag is hidden in a cushion. The bag contained a jar filled with white powder and police believed it was drugs (either cocaine or heroin). A few weeks later the police learned that the white powder collected from Sedrati is cyanide, which suggested that Sedrati poisoned Gassen with cyanide (the police also discovered that Sedrati bought 20&amp;nbsp;kg of cyanide under the identity of a certain Joel Royer). The police began to catch a glimpse of what happened to Sedrati: Gassen had an appointment with Philippe Grossiord but it was Nadir Sedrati who received it. Sedrati had to tell Gassen that he had to wait for Grossiord; this last coming Sedrati have proposed to Gassen to have a cup of coffee mixed with cyanide. Gassen suffocated, fainted and somebody (presumably Sedrati) dismembered his body, whose various pieces were thrown into the canal.

But what puzzled the authorities is that Gassen's head was in a state of advanced decomposition. They thought that the head was thrown into the canal 6 weeks ago while Gassen had died 2 to 3 weeks ago. Digging again in Sedrati's apartment they discovered in the basement lime and learned that the lime can delay the identification of a body when a part of the body was immersed in it, whereas Gassen's head seemed more rotten for the others.

Nadir Sedrati was brought before the investigating judge and was subsequently imprisoned. He claimed he was innocent and the police discovered that Sedrati had no apparent motive to kill Gassen if not for the money, because Sedrati had stolen the victim's bank card to make some withdrawals (300 francs).

=== The second body ===
Police now had to solve the mystery of the third patella found at the same time as Gassen's pieces. They learned that Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, two other killers who knew Nadir Sedrati, have been missing since spring 1999. The police thought that either Steil or Ronfort was the second victim found in the canal. For this, they decided appeal to the family of the missing men to take a DNA sample. This was complicated, but the police still managed to collect the DNA of two people (a close friend of Steil and a close friend of Ronfort). Pending the results, the investigation showed that Gérard Steil was released from prison in October 1998 and that he found work for six months in Strasbourg as a delivery driver and housed in a home in the city.

His contract soon expired, but Steil still planned to work under a certain Philippe Grossiord, who had contacted him for work within his company Inter Europe Diffusion. Gérard Steil made the trip by train from Strasbourg to Nancy for the job interview, where he must have been with Grossiord and had to be back in Strasbourg on Monday morning. Steil arrived at the company, which turned out to be a fictional company invented by Grossiord (AKA Sedrati). The company's headquarters were located in a room at the back of Nadir Sedrati's apartment.

Then Sedrati called the home in which Steil lodged and that he would not come back because he started work in society. The police quickly concluded that Sedrati killed Steil. However the motive for the crime was unknown but the police believed that only interest for Sedrati to kill Steil was the poor pension that affected the victim. Moreover, the second patella belonged to Steil, so the police and the River Brigade of Nancy decided to drain the whole canal to find possible remains. In November 1999, remains were recovered in the canal and actually belonged to Gérard Steil.

=== A third victim? ===
Moreover, Norbert Ronfort, another acquaintance of Sedrati who disappeared just like Steil, left prison in early 1999 and had a goal: get in touch with his family and buy a motorhome. The police also learned that Ronfort had told Nadir Sedrati about his plans and that he received a phone call from Inter Europe Diffusion. The company boasted about selling motorhomes and, attracted by the offer of a certain Philippe Grossiord, Ronfort had agreed to meet him to acquire the motorhome. Since this conversation, Norbert Ronfort disappeared and his body still hasn't been found.

Nadir Sedrati was indicted in the murder of Hans Gassen, Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, even though his body was never found.

== Trial ==
The trial of Nadir Sedrati began in April 2002 and lasted several days. Sedrati still proclaiming his innocence. The blood found on the linoleum and on the sink made it possible to confirm that Sedrati had killed his victim(s) in the kitchen.

Sedrati was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 20-year lock-in period. He tried to appeal this conviction.

== Second trial ==
Nadir Sedrati's second appeal trial opened in May 2003. In this second trial, Sedrati seemed tired and sad. A dramatic twist occurred: a jailed woman who knew Norbert Ronfort claimed to have seen him in 2000 (one year after Sedrati's arrest). A bailiff was sworn in to question this woman about what she knew. The young woman claimed to know Norbert Ronfort and claimed that they had crossed paths in 2000. Her testimony seemed coherent and in good faith. Norbert Ronfort's location then hovered over the Sedrati trial.

Psychiatric experts say Sedrati could re-offend anytime. Moreover, he usurped the identity of two other missing persons (one in 1985 and another in 1995) and was accused of murdering them. The bodies of these two people have not been found to date.

The jury did not take into account the testimony of the imprisoned woman and resentenced Nadir Sedrati to life imprisonment with a 22-year lock-in period.

Sedrati appealed in cassation. His appeal was dismissed in October 2003.

'''Giuseppe Sasia''' (born May 26, 1886 - February 17, 1936), known as '''The Shepherds' Killer''' and '''The Haut-Var Killer''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and [[serial killer]], who, in the span of several months in 1934, killed at least 4 men in [[Draguignan]], [[France]], with the aim of stealing from them. He was later [[guillotine]]d for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-temps/9-decembre-1934/123/649815/3|title=The Time (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Giuseppe Sasia arrived in France at the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-populaire/8-decembre-1934/110/1189579/1|title=Le Populaire (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 10.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal/6-novembre-1935/100/407255/5|title=Le Petit Journal (November 6, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an Italian farmer who settled in the country with his family.

He wasn't very sociable, and scared his neighbors, but nevertheless, he had a girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k628300t|title=Le Petit Parisien: daily newspaper of the evening|last=|first=|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for a while at a restaurant in Draguignan, a town where he went to buy ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-marseillais/9-decembre-1934/437/1804797/2|title=Le Petit Marseillais (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, he had an affair with a woman from Draguignan, who rejected him because he was poor.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; The woman whom rejected owned a bar in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-journal/8-decembre-1934/100/425641/3|title=Le Petit Journal (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
His crimes were committed in a particular area; the journalists grouped them under the name of "The Crimes of Haut-Var".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k578554p|title=Le Matin: last telegrams of the night|last=|first=|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Roumo ===
Joseph Roumo was murdered in front of his shop in [[Flayosc]], in 1930.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k46995074|title=Le Peuple: daily organ of unionism|author=General Confederation of Labor|date=December 8, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in similar circumstances to the other four victims, but Sasia wasn't prosecuted for this crime.

=== Marius Vassal ===
While napping near an oak tree in [[Taradeau]], Vassal, a horticulturist, was shot dead on March 4, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4619921k|title=L'Œuvre|last=|first=|date=November 5, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7640066q|title=Paris-soir|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later found hidden, and the hundred [[franc]]s he was carrying on him were gone.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; At first, the judge indicted a "lunatic" for this killing, who dies shortly after his arrest.

=== Fernand Troin ===
Troin was murdered in Flayosc, on August 5, 1934.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/7-novembre-1935/677/2987907/6|title=Le Petit Provençal (November 7, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The octogenarian was returning home with provisions, when he passed by the place where his soon-to-be-killer was hiding. The latter shot Fernand, stealing his food and the ten francs he was carrying.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; A postwoman, who claimed to have seen the killer, was later unable to recognize Sasia at trial.

=== Félicien Rouvier ===
Félicien Rouvier, 35, was murdered on October 19, 1934, at [[Ampus]].&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Sasia, who was familiar with the place, also knew that the shepherd was gone during the day, and that he had money on him. He placed himself in an alcove, until Félicien returned with his sheep at nightfall. As he entered the house, he was shot with [[Shotgun shell|buckshot]], and collapsed on the ground.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Sasia then stole a watch, handkerchief, and the 137-160 francs, while the victim lay dying.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

He confessed the crime after Rouvier's watch was discovered in his pockets, after he was arrested. He claimed to have killed Félicien, as he needed money to pay some fines.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=== Gianni Galliano ===
The 26-year-old chauffeur Galliano, who was on a work-related trip, was murdered in [[Vérignon]] on November 30, 1934.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7633941n|title=Le Journal|last=|first=|date=November 6, 1935|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; While searching through Sasia's home, the gendarmes discovered Galliano's glove, leading to the first confessions. Sasia claimed to have had an altercation with the chauffeur on the road to [[Canjuers]], deciding to shoot and rob him, before hiding the body. He shouted for Gianni to stop the vehicle, before shooting him.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The mobile was the same one as Félicien Rouvier's.

== Arrest ==
Sasia was arrested by two policemen patrolling along the railway linking [[Vidauban]] to [[Les Arcs, Var|Les Arcs]]. He was walking around with his rifle by his side, perhaps looking for a new victim,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/la-tribune-de-l-aube/8-decembre-1934/1217/3194659/2|title=La Tribune (December 8, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his attitude provoked the interested of the policemen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; His appearance corresponded to the report broadcast eight days earlier. As Sasia could not present a hunting permit, he was taken in by the gendarmerie, to which he instantly admitted to having hunted without a license, as well as confessing to his theft convictions. Giuseppe claimed to reside in the neighborhood of Nouradons aux Arcs.

The gendarmes discovered on him the watch stolen from the corpse of Félicien Rouvier, prompting Sasia to quickly confess his guilt. He explained that he premeditated the action, waiting for the shepherd to arrive before killing him. From the on, the gendarmes searched his home, where they found six watches, five wallets and a pair of gloves, which turned out to be Galliano's. Sasia admitted to that murder as well, claiming at first that they had fought before, before acknowledging that he killed Gianni so he could rob him.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Soon after, he acknowledged the murder of Vassal and Troin, but denied responsibility for the 1930 crime.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When presented before the magistrate on the following day, he partly recanted his confession, recognizing only the two crimes for which there was evidence: those of Rouvier and Galliano. He claimed to have committed the crimes so he could pay his fines and evade prison. The investigators discovered two transfers made on the days after the two murders, and the presence of several watches raised concerns about other possible victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-populaire/9-decembre-1934/110/1470579/2|title=Le Populaire (December 9, 1934)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia declared after his arrest: "I deserve the guillotine".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; On December 18, he was charged with four murders, premeditated murder, followed by theft, and highway robbery with aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4699518x|title=Le Peuple: daily organ of unionism|author=General Confederation of Labor|date=December 19, 1934|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==
He was tried before the [[cour d'assises]] on November 5, 1935.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Sasia acknowledged the murders of Rouvier and Galliano, but plead [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], trying to present it as a failed robbery. He denied being the perpetrator of the other two killings.

Experts analyzed that the four victims were shot in similar circumstances, with buckshot at 4–5 meters in the shootings.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The chief doctor of the asylum, Dr. Pierrefeu, noted that Sasia was fully aware of his actions.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She declared: "He is a man who possesses to a high degree the feel of material things, and who has the mentality of a man of the woods; he is far from civilized. His mental level is low and, by poaching, he has assimilated men to the animals he was killing. His emotivity is null and his regret is purely verbal. But Sasia is not crazy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Watchmakers, who had repaired Vassal's watch on previous occasions, recognized it when it was shown to them by the gendarmes.:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

After several minutes of deliberation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/excelsior/7-novembre-1935/353/2773791/1/bb1586c5a31372b6b3c4d2d7fa7323ad|title=Giuseppe Sasia is condemned to death|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; jurors recognized him as guilty of the four murders and condemned him to the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Over five hundred people attended the last day of the trial.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

== Execution ==
His clemency was rejected,&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; despite a meeting between his lawyer and the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75974242|title=The free man: daily newspaper morning / editor, Georges Clemenceau; Director, Fr. Albert|last=|first=|date=February 11, 1936|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia showed no regret before his conviction. During his detention on the [[death row]], he requested the support of an [[almoner]] and began to regret his actions.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k47292616|title=Paris-midi: only daily newspaper appearing at noon / dir. Maurice de Waleffe|last=|first=|date=February 17, 1936|website=Gallica|language=FR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not support the approach chosen for his execution, and had several crises of despair. After the execution of Niccolini in [[Avignon]], the guillotine was brought to Draguignan.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/16-fevrier-1936/677/2988107/5|title=Le Petit Provençal (February 16, 1936)|publisher=Retronews - Press site for the BNF site|accessdate=November 23, 2019|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasia was executed on February 17, 1936, at 6:10 on La République Street, in front of the Draguignan Prison.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; While it was deployed in the public square, a large part of the service was set up to prevent from attending the execution.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.retronews.fr/journal/le-petit-provencal/18-fevrier-1936/677/2988101/5|title=Le Petit Provençal (February 18, 1936)|last=|first=|date=|website=Retronews - The press site of the BnF|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his lawyer, his last words were: "It's annoying to die".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; His body was later deposited at the Draguignan cemetery.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Controversy over deportation ==
A controversy arose from the fact that Sasia, an Italian national, was the subject of a deportation order from the gendarmes, since his first conviction. This, however, had not been applied: the prefecture's secretary was accused of favoring extremist immigrants, and thereafter removed from office.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Known as '''The Sadist of Rincón''', he kidnapped, raped and murdered 5 minors, as well as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.msn.com/es-co/noticias/colombia/los-peores-asesinos-seriales-de-la-historia-de-colombia/ss-AApDlWV?parent-title=ministro-botero-en-el-ojo-del-hurac%C3%A1n&amp;parent-ns=ar&amp;parent-content-id=BBWnPIW&amp;fullscreen=true#image=8|title=The worst serial killers in the history of Colombia|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=August 26, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he carried out the murders between 1995 and 1997 in the town of [[Suba, Bogotá|Suba]], during which he dismembered his victims and disposed of their remains in [[Bin bag|bin bags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.cablenoticias.tv/vernoticia.asp?wplaca=75427&amp;fb_comment_id=1071144556299277_1071335642946835|title=These are serial killers that frightened Colombia|publisher=[[Cablenoticias]]|accessdate=August 26, 2019|language=Spanish}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently held in Acacías Prison, in the [[Meta Department]], for the murder of his wife.&lt;ref name=sad&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.radiosantafe.com/2014/04/10/piden-condena-contra-hombre-que-abuso-y-desaparecio-a-5-ninas-de-suba/|title=They're asking for a sentence against a man who abused and killed 5 girls from Suba|publisher=[[Radio Santa Fe]]|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murders ==
According to the authorities' investigations, Malagón Suárez committed the murders in the 1990s, in the town of Suba. The victims were identified as Yulie Yesenia Chacón, Andrea García López, Nina Johana Moncada, Yolanda Perdomo and Lid Consuelo Pineda, all minors who lived in the Rincón neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.publimetro.co/co/bogota/2018/03/07/abusadores-y-asesinos-en-serie-en-colombia.html|title=In the minds of the cruelest murderers and abusers of Colombia|author=Ginna Rincón and Pamela López|publisher=Publiometro|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigator of the [[Administrative Department of Security|DAS]] affirmed that it took 4 years of investigations so Malagón Suárez could be captured; his daughter also told the authorities that in one of the rooms of the house where they lived, constant screams were heard, which Luis claimed came from the neighborhood cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.infobae.com/america/colombia/2018/05/12/el-cruel-escenario-de-tortura-al-que-han-sido-sometidos-los-ninos-en-la-historia-de-colombia/|title=The cruel scene of torture of which children have been subjected in the history of Colombia|author=Adriana Chica|publisher=[[Infobae]]|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the DAS finished the investigation and conducted a search of the house, in which they found various belongings of the victims, among them - clothes, jewels, semen from the killer, hair, saliva and a sharp object.&lt;ref name=suba&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1336175|title=Murderer of Suba girls captured|publisher=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the bodies of the murdered children were placed inside bin bags and hidden, since they were never found.&lt;ref name=suba/&gt; One of Malagón's daughters also claimed that he would take the teenage girls to his residence, where he subsequently abuse them, tying up their hands and feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/fiscalia-pide-condenar-luis-alberto-malagon-suarez-por-muerte-de-cinco-ninas/383297-3|title=Condemnation requested for alleged killer of Suba girls|publisher=[[Semana]]|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the judge presiding over the case dismissed it, resulting in Malagón Suárez's acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://noticias.canalrcn.com/nacional-justicia/absuelven-unico-sospechoso-desaparicion-cinco-ninas|title=Absolutely only suspect ind disappearance of five girls|publisher=RCN News|accessdate=August 27, 2019|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[modus operandi]] was always the same. Working as a taxi driver, he intercepted young people with offers of free rides, then would take them somewhere remote, where he would rape and kill them with blows to the head. Later, Silva would throw the bodies in deep abandoned mines. He was convicted of killing 14 women and was sentenced to life imprisonment on February 26, 2004.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Locker |first1=Melissa |title=South America's 8 Scariest Serial Killers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/south-americas-8-scariest-serial-killers-112761/julio-perez-silva-chile-113020/ |accessdate=30 July 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
"Segua", as he was called in his childhood, spent most of years among the streets of [[Puchuncaví]]. Those who knew at the school where he studied agreed that he was a quiet, introverted student.

He married at the age of 22 to Monica Cistemas, a native of [[La Calera, Chile|La Calera]], and they had two daughters. Then, he spent five years with Marianela Vergara, who already had two other daughters. With her he returned to Puchuncaví and reaped the reputation of a good husband.

In the mid-1990s he emigrated to Iquique looking for better job opportunities, finding a job loading sacks of salt. At a party he met Nancy Boero, fourteen years older than him and a mother of six children. After two weeks they were living together and then settled in Alto Hospicio, in a sector known as "La Negra". Later they would move to "Autoconstruccíon", another local sector.

Soon, he left his job to start as a taxi driver illegally. It was then that he began a string of crimes, all of similar characteristics.

==Crimes==
On September 17, 1998, he picked up 17-year-old Montserrat Graciela Saravia on the waterfront of Iquique. According to his confession, she offered him money in exchange for sex. However, this young woman's real intention was to steal from him. When he noticed this, he beat her to death and left her on a beach.

On November 24, 1999, while driving in Alto Hospicio, he offered 13-year-old Macarena Sanchez a ride to her school. After threatening her with a knife and raping her, he tied her hands and threw her into the Huantajaya Pique, which is more 220 meters deep.

In February 2000 he attacked twice in less than a week; the first was Sara Gomez on February 21, and just 2 days later 23-year-old cellphone promoter Angelica Lay, both of whom were killed in the middle of the desert.

On March 23 of the same year, exactly one month after the fourth murder, he assaulted and murdered 14-year-old Laura Zola, and like Sanchez, she was raped and murdered in Huantajaya.

Then, on April 5, he attacked Katherine Arce, whom he raped and murdered like Angelica Lay, then buried her body in an unofficial garbage dump.

On May 22, 17-year-old Patricia Palma left the lyceum on her way home. It was at that moment that Silva kidnapped, raped and killed her, leaving her body in Huantajaya along with the corpses of Sanchez and Zola.

Eleven days later, on June 2, he attacked again. He raped and murdered Macarena Montecinos in the "Pampa El Molle" sector, who suffered the same fate as Lay and Arce. The same fate befell 15-year-old Viviana Garay, who was intercepted, raped and killed with a blow to the head. The luck would be different this time, since the father of the last minor mobilized the relatives of other victims, who according to the authorities and the police had fled from their homes, immersed in poverty, to [[Peru]] or [[Bolivia]], looking for a better future.

Because of this, Perez did not attack for nine months, but on April 17, 2001, he struck again in the sector "Autoconstrccíon" where he intercepted a child under 16 years identified as Maritza, threatening her with a knife and raping her, but did not kill her. Later she managed to escape and returned home. They took her to the hospital, where they took samples of the aggressor's [[semen]]. Although Maritza wasn't able to see her attacker due to the darkness, months later, when they checked him, she recognized his voice. They compared the DNA samples and they were identical.

==Reactions of the press and victims' relatives==
During all that time, the mysterious disappearances of so many young women from Alto Hospicio reached national coverage. However, the authorities of the time - mainly under the Secretary of Interior at the time, [[Jorge Burgos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|title=Burgos describes "legitimate" manifestations of relatives of victims of the Psychopath of Alto Hospicio against their appointment|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2014/02/674-567277-9-burgos-califica-como-legitimas-manifestaciones-de-familiares-de-victimas-de.shtml|publisher=La Tercera|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=25 June 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and the police assumed that it was most likely that the young people fled their homes due to poverty, possibly migrating to [[Tacna]] or Bolivia. There were even some suggestions that the girls probably engaged in prostitution. This fact diverted even more attention from the true motive of the disappearances.

However, with the disappearance of Viviana Garay generated a totally unexpected reaction. The father of the girl, Orlando Garay, mobilized the other affected families. Only then did the event become news, so the crimes briefly stopped.

The Mea Culpa program made a special about this case in 2003.

==Discovery of the murderer==
===Searching for the truth===
Orlando Garay, father of one of the victims Viviana Garay, began to fight for the truth and did not accept the authorities' speculations, selling his fisherman's boat to gather the families of other disappeared girls to find answers. On July 18, 2000, a bag and clothes belonging to Viviana were found on a rubbish dump where, according to her family and friends, she never went to; That same day, in another landfill, the neighbours found Katherine Acre's backpack and uniform. On July 20, Inés Valdivia, mother of Patricia Palma, distinguished her daughter's underwear in a ravine. This was how family members, friends and neighbours looked for the young women.

===Last crime and arrest===
On October 4, 2001, Perez made this last attack, when a young woman identified as Bárbara Nuñez survived. He intercepted and attacked in the same way he did with other victims, the difference was that Silva confessed to being the murderer; After he had hit her with a stone on the head and thinking she was dead, he left. Bárbara survived however, and managed to report the attack. That same day he was arrested; without any remorse he admitted to the murders and rapes, also confessing to having acted alone and denying having [[dementia]]. After his arrest, Perez provided the necessary information to locate the other victims' bodies. Currently, he is monitored 24 hours a day and is subjected to sleep control, after he once tried to commit suicide in his cell with a shoelace wound to a toothbrush.

So far, the names of five other disappeared young and adult women emerged in Alto Hospicio area between April 1999 and August 2001. However, Silva claims to know nothing about them.

===Condemnation===
Finally, on February 26, 2004, Perez, 40 years old at the time, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole  for the murders of 11 adolescents and 3 adults in the attempted murder of other 2. He is currently incarcerated in the high security prison of Colina I in [[Santiago]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/pais/judicial/alto-hospicio/sicopata-de-alto-hospicio-fue-condenado-a-cadena-perpetua-simple/2004-02-26/135929.html "Psychopath of Alto Hospicio" was sentenced to simple life imprisonment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==
According to the investigations, the 14 victims of Julio Pérez Silva, murdered between September 12, 1998 and August 23, 2001, would be:

'''Ludwig Slavov Tolumov''' (born 1950) and '''Ivan Serafimov Ivanov''' (born 1956 - July 15, 2000), also known jointly as '''The Sour and The Sweet''', were a pair of [[Bulgaria]]n robbers, rapists and [[serial killer]]s who, in the span of two months in 2000, murdered 3 people and robbed several others. Serafimov, who was solely responsible for a murder in 1996, was shot by his partner Tolumov, who himself was subsequently apprehended and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name=sketch&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/3236511|title=Cruel killer captured due to portrait, sketched by policeman|author=Anelia Percheva|publisher=24 Chasa|date=12 February 2014|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evil&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.crimes.bg/%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/8310-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%86%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE-%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BE.html|title=Bulgaria's Serial Killers. The Deadly Duo|publisher=crimes.bg|date=18 January 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographies==
===Early lives===
Both Tolumov and Serafimov were born in the little village of Duvanli, where they were childhood friends, but eventually separated after the former moved to [[Hisar, Bulgaria|Hisar]] so he could live with new wife, Penka, who later gave birth to three children. Not long after, Ludwig went on to temporarily live in [[Germany]], before moving to [[Namibia]]. In the meantime, Serafimov became a habitual criminal, spending a total of 15 years behind bars after 8 consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery. While imprisoned, he earned the nickname "The Sweet" because of his ability to sweet talk and his love for sweets.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

After many years, while Serafimov was serving his 8th sentence for robbery in the Plovdiv Prison, he reunited with Tolumov, who was imprisoned for theft. During this prison stint, they decided to form their deadly criminal duet. After Serafimov's release in March 2000, he returned to a life of crime, now aided by his partner.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;
===First murder===
On May 13, 2000, a couple, consisting of 19-year-old Ruzhdiye Useinova from Pravoslaven and 20-year-old Sevgin Myumyun from Voden, had decided to go to a disco in the "Mogilata" complex near the village of [[Varbitsa, Haskovo Province]]. They had stopped at a gas station near [[Byala Reka, Plovdiv Province|Byala Reka]] to gas up their car, before continuing on their journey, only to stop again to the side of the road 20 minutes after midnight, so they could talk and kiss each other. Suddenly, from the darkness the silhouettes of two men appeared, who immediately attacked the couple without saying a word. The criminals broke the car's window and with slaps and kicks pulled out Sevgin and Ruzhdiye from the vehicle. They tried to attack the girl, whose boyfriend tried to defend her. However, Sevgin was beaten harshly, before being shot in the eyesocket and the spine. They lied to the girl that they had only knocked him out, and he'd be awake after 3-4 hours. The men then robbed the corpse of his gold earrings and rings, his telephone and cassette player, and then dragged it to some bushes by the road. Tolumov and Serafimov then forced the shocked Ruzhdiye into the car, driving her to a small chapel called "St. Elijah", where they brutally beat and subsequently raped her, one after the other.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

After the brutal deed, they proceeded to stab her 8 times in the neck, breasts and stomach before fleeing the scene, thinking they had eliminated their only witness, relying on the fact that the authorities might think that the murders were a result from a love-related drama between the two. However, Useinova had miraculously survived, the blade from the knife just barely missing her [[external carotid artery]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; After being unconscious for some time, the tortured woman eventually woke up, and managed to crawl her way to the road after some hours, where she was accidentally found by a [[Parvomay]] policeman. Barely managing to utter that she was attacked, she again lapsed into unconsciousness, whereupon the officer immediately brought her to the hospital. During the subsequent search of the area, Myumyun's body was located.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

While she was recovering from her injuries in hospital, Useinova was visited by the now-retired police sketch artist Atanas Marincheshki, to whom she described the offenders.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt; The man managed to produce an incredibly accurate [[facial composite]] of Tolumov, as couldn't do the same for Serafimov, who had tried to hide his face from the victim.

Shortly following the attack, the authorities managed to shorten the suspect circle to 20 names in the criminal registry, with detectives from the National Police's "Murders" Unit aiding the Plovdiv authorities, working 24 hours a day so they could resolve the crime.

===Robberies and thefts===
In the meantime, Tolumov and Serafimov continued with the criminal deeds. On June 6, the duo attacked a parked minibus in the "[[Troyan]]-Karnare" Pass, stealing combine parts and personal items worth 8265 [[Bulgarian lev|leva]]. They threatened the driver, Tanyo Bahchevanski, and proceeded to steal the minibus itself, only to later abandon it.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

Five days later, they beat up and robbed a female taxi driver near the village of Belovitsa, and not long after, robbed a man from [[Sofia]] along the [[Trakia motorway]].&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; Three weeks after that, near the village of Mihiltsi, they robbed a man and a woman in a parked [[Moskvitch]]. The men fired at the car and forced to driver to lay down on the ground, but he managed to flee and call for help at a nearby gas station. Tolumov abandoned his partner, while Serafimov got into the car and forced the woman to have sex with him.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

===Double murder===
On July 12, a body was found by accident near the architectural-historical memorial "Arch of Freedoms" in [[Beklemeto Pass]]. It was later revealed that on that day Tolumov and Serafimov had stopped the car of German tourists Christian Herlem and Heidi Colomb, both from [[Kassel]] - near [[Pavel Banya]]. There, they killed Herlem and later dropped off his body into the abyss, before taking Colomb to Mount Bratan, where she was reportedly raped. After raping her, both men threw the woman into the nearby swamp, effectively drowning her. Her skull was later located, with parts of her body scattered around the place, most likely by wild animals.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;

The police quickly contacted German authorities, sending the victims' items to them. In order to capture the bandits, agents from [[Interpol]] took action, drawing accurate facial composites of the criminals in accordance to the surviving victims.

==Serafimov's death and Tolumov's capture==
While the investigators were working on capturing the criminals, distrust began to settle between Tolumov and Serafimov. On July 15, while driving towards [[Hisarya, Bulgaria|Hisarya]], the two began arguing. Tolumov, suspecting that his childhood friend was planning to kill him, offered to stop the car. Immediately after this, he pulled out his gun and shot Serafimov, killing him on the spot.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;&lt;ref name=evil/&gt; He then put his body in the trunk of the car and dropped it off at a ditch near Tsarimir. To erase his traces, he later burned the car.

Between July 19 and 20, a man and a woman working for TV company Evrokom, while trying to shoot footage for a film, accidentally found the body of a man who was dressed in a sailor's shirt and looked to be around his 40s. He had gunshot wounds to his back and chest area. Later fingerprint examinations proved that it was indeed Ivan "The Sweet" Serafimov.

The police then proceeded to question his friends, calling in a total of 9 people, among them two women and a [[Vietnam|Vietnamese]] man. The deceased eerily matched the description of one of the perpetrators who had attacked Ruzhdiye Useinova, while his buddy Ludwig Tolumov looked like the other man. After a brief investigation, it was concluded that they had done a number of violent crimes, and that Tolumov had killed his partner. He was arrested in Hisarya soon after, without offering any resistance. Ludwig confessed to the rape of Useinova and the thefts, but denied the murders, only admitting to that of Serafimov, claiming to have done it to protect the lives of his family and other people.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

==Evidence==
The authorities had strong evidence, including DNA samples, to convict Tolumov. It was determined that a pistol with a silencer was used in the murders of Herlem and Serafimov, while in the murder of Myumyun - an [[MP 40]]. In accordance to the different situations, the criminals would use either of the two weapons. The MP 40 was later found on August 10 in Tolumov's home.

Although apparent that Serafimov was the main act in the murders, Tolumov acted as his accomplice without hesitation. Not only this, but the former is also thought to be responsible for the 1996 murder of a woman named Elena Filipova, in her home near the Plovdiv Boulevard "Maritsa".&lt;ref name=evil/&gt;&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

According to the psychoanalysis of Ludwig Tolumov, he is [[egocentrism|egocentric]], selfish and demands control of others, feeling good when he controls the course of action and dominates over everybody else. He is devoid of any regret and likes to show off, but also stands out with a high degree of self-control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Trial and sentence==
During Tolumov's trial, he stated that the murder charges should be dropped, as he had acted in self-defence. After hearing this, Embie Myumyun, Sevgin's mother, began cussing at him. Sitting next to her was the still shocked Ruzhdiye. On July 3, 2003, Tolumov was sentenced to the harshest sentence available for aggravated murder - life imprisonment. He would have to serve it in the Plovdiv Central Prison under a special regime. In his last words to the court, he said the following:&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt;

{{cquote|quote="I'm sorry for some of the deeds, but I'm not responsible for the robbery and murder of Sevgin. I admit to participating in the rape of the girl, but I was forced to do so by Ivan, if it wasn't for me, the girl wouldn't be alive."}}

The magistrates also gave a guilty verdict over robbing tourists at Beklemeto Pass in June 2000, as well giving an additional 15 years imprisonment for murdering Ivan Serafimov.

==Aftermath==
On August 11, 2011, Ludwig's 22-year-old son, Slavi, was found hanging in the family home in Duvanli. Slavi had lived with his mother's family in Hisar's Catholic district, where his grandfather Milan was looking after him, as his mother was working abroad in [[Italy]]. His death was ruled a suicide, most likely due to the fact he couldn't suffer living with the knowledge that his father was a brutal killer. Just a month before, he had moved back to Duvanli and the empty house, which was abandoned after the grandparents had died years before. The villagers noted that he seemed depressed, didn't speak to anyone and refused to go to the café with friends. The boy had worked in Italy as a builder on request by his mother, but he had decided to return to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.karlovo-online.com/hisar/item/1593-%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86-%D1%81%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B8|title=Son of a serial killer hanged himself|publisher=Karlovo Online|date=18 August 2011|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Penka, had also lost her other son 2 years before. She currently lives isolated in a monastery.&lt;ref name=sketch/&gt; In response to this, Tolumov commented that this ruined his parents, who died during the trial, and that he still keeps the necrologues of his sons. He also said that he keeps regular contact with the priest in Novi Khan, sending him money for his children over [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.lifebites.bg/killer-bestseller/|title=Killer writes best-seller in prison|author=Borislav Radoslavov and Borislav Troshev|publisher=lifebites.bg|date=24 August 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Tolumov and another murderer, Dimitar Harakchiev, were awarded compensation of 3000 and 4000 leva following a trial in the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], due to the bad hygiene, ventilation and other problems which went on in the prison's cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://dnes.dir.bg/politika/kilii-toaletni-evropeyski-sad-pravata-%D1%87oveka-loshi-uslovia-17029400|title=Murderers sentenced Bulgaria for cells without toilets|publisher=Dnes.dir.bg|date=12 July 2014|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned, Tolumov began writing an autobiography, detailing all the events of his life leading up to his arrest. He said the book would be called "Chronicles of a Life Sentence". His prison cell is considered lavish, as he has a flat screen TV, coffee machine, radio, a metal fan, renewed window panels and an old typing machine, on which he is currently writing the book.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/4936406|title=Ludwig Tolumov: I shot my friend with 4 bullets|author=Borislav Radoslavov|publisher=[[24 Chasa]]|date=21 August 2015|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1995, Selena's family discovered that Saldívar was [[embezzlement|embezzling]] money from both the fan club and boutiques, which led to her firing in the first week of March.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes" /&gt; On the morning of March 31, Selena agreed to meet Saldívar at a [[Days Inn]] motel in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]&lt;ref name="DaysInn"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070405104003/http://chron.com/content/chronicle/metropolitan/selena/transcripts/95/10/13/param.html "Testimony of Richard Fredrickson".] ''Houston Chronicle'', October 13, 1995.

==Trial and imprisonment==
{{Main|Trial of Yolanda Saldívar}}
[[File:Entrance to TDCJ Mountain View Unit.jpg|thumb|[[Mountain View Unit]], where Saldívar is being held]]
Saldívar's trial for the murder of Selena was followed closely by the Latino community in the United States. The trial was not televised, but cameras were permitted on the courthouse premises. The venue was moved to Houston, Texas, after Saldívar's lawyers successfully argued that she could not receive a fair trial in Selena's home town. Before the start of the trial, [[CNN]] reported that prosecutors were expected to introduce a controversial police confession signed by Saldívar in which she said she shot Selena "during an argument over accusations from the singer's father that Saldívar stole money from Selena's accounts". The defense was expected to introduce testimony from [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Robert Garza that "he overheard Saldívar claim the shooting was accidental, and that she objected when police failed to include it in her statement".&lt;ref name="trial begins" /&gt;

The defense attorney argued the shooting was accidental, but the prosecution pointed out that Saldívar, a trained nurse, did not call [[9-1-1|911]] nor try to help Selena after she was shot.&lt;ref name="Foundguilty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9510/selena/10-23/pm/index.html|title=Yolanda Saldivar found guilty of Selena's murder|publisher=CNN|date=23 October 1995|accessdate=17 August 2015|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saldívar claimed that the gun "[accidentally] went off". The gun, a .38{{nbsp}}caliber [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver, has been said to require 11{{nbsp}}pounds of pressure on the trigger to fire,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} a fact which led prosecutors to conclude that the gun could only have discharged if the trigger was intentionally pulled. The judge did not give the jury the option of lesser charges of [[manslaughter]] or [[negligent homicide]], and told the jurors they must convict or acquit Saldívar on the sole charge of [[Murder|first-degree murder]].

Jurors deliberated for less than three hours on October{{nbsp}}23, 1995, before finding Saldívar guilty of first-degree murder.&lt;ref name="Foundguilty"/&gt; Three days later, on October{{nbsp}}26, she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in thirty years; this was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas at the time.&lt;ref name="sentencing-CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9510/selena/10-26/index.html|title=Selena's killer receives life sentence|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=26 October 1995|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 1995,&lt;!--23 November 1995 was a Thursday--&gt; she arrived at the Gatesville Unit (now the [[Christina Melton Crain Unit]]) in [[Gatesville, Texas]], to be processed.&lt;ref name="Process"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=David |title=Somber Saldivar delivered to prison – Convicted murderer of Tejano star Selena keeps head down during processing |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAFE785145D688E&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=23 November 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saldívar is serving a life sentence at the [[Mountain View Unit]] in Gatesville, operated by the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]]. She will become eligible for parole on March{{nbsp}}30, 2025.&lt;ref name="JailRecord"&gt;{{cite web |title=Offender Information Detail Saldivar, Yolanda |url=http://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05422564 |website=Texas Department of Criminal Justice |agency= |date=26 October 1995  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225150220/http://offender.tdcj.texas.gov/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05422564 |archivedate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KSAT"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Perez|first1= Nicole |title=NO, Yolanda Saldivar did not die in prison |url=http://www.ksat.com/news/no-yolanda-saldivar-did-not-die-in-prison |accessdate=25 December 2015 |work=[[KSAT-TV]] |date=17 August 2015| quote=Saldivar is serving a life sentence at the state's Mountain View Facility in Gatesville for the 1995 murder of Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the conviction==
The revolver used to kill Selena disappeared after the trial and was later found in the home of a court reporter. Despite objections from some historical groups, it was dismantled and the pieces thrown into [[Corpus Christi Bay]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/08/us/national-briefing-southwest-texas-gun-that-killed-singer-is-to-be-destroyed.html|title=Gun That Killed Singer Is To Be Destroyed|date=8 June 2002|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saldívar has asked the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] to accept a petition that challenges her conviction. She claims the petition was filed in 2000 with the 214th District Court, but was never sent to the higher court. Her request was received on March{{nbsp}}31, 2008, the thirteenth anniversary of Selena's death.&lt;ref name="Writ"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Cavazos | first1= Mary Ann |date=1 April 2008 | url=http://www.caller.com/news/2008/apr/01/yolanda/   | title=Selena's Killer Ask s Court to Review Writ | work= Caller-Times | publisher=USA Today  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080726012700/http://www.caller.com/news/2008/apr/01/yolanda/ | archivedate=26 July 2008  | accessdate= 6 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Ludwig Sand''' ([[Wunsiedel]], [[Upper Franconia]] (then in [[Prussia]]), 5 October 1795 – [[Mannheim]], 20 May 1820) was a [[Germany|German]] university student and member of a liberal [[Burschenschaft]] (student association). He was executed in 1820 for the murder of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] dramatist [[August von Kotzebue]] the previous year in [[Mannheim]].   As a result of his execution, Sand became a martyr in the eyes of many German nationalists seeking the creation of a united German national state.

==Biography==
Karl Ludwig Sand was born to Gottfried Christoph Sand and his wife Dorothea Johanna Wilhelmina Schöpf (1766–1826), on 5 October 1795. His siblings were George, Fritz, Caroline and Julia.

===Education===
[[File:Wartburg-Studentenzug-1817.jpg|thumb|Students marching towards the Wartburg, of which Sand was one.]]
In 1804 he attended the ''Lateinschule'' (Latin school) in [[Wunsiedel]] and in 1810 he moved on to the grammar school (''Gymnasium'') in [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], living with the school's rector, [[Georg Heinrich Saalfrank]], a friend of Sand's Enlightened Protestant family. Following the closure of the Hof Gymnasium on the institution of [[Montgelas]]'s Reforms, Sand followed his teacher to the Neues Gymnasium (New Grammar School) in [[Regensburg]], completing his studies in September 1814. In November 1814 Sand matriculated at the [[University of Tübingen]].

In 1815, Sand volunteered under Major von Falkenhausen, participating in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June and in Paris by July. He returned from the war disillusioned with its results and fell into a deep depression. In 1816, while at the [[University of Erlangen]], Sand formed Burschenschaft Teutonia with his friend Dittmar, meeting at castle ruins near Erlangen which they had named Ruttli. They built a meeting house for their group of 80 students. Sand's depression was further intensified by the destruction of Ruttli by the competing political group the Landmannschaft and the drowning death of Dittmar in 1817. Starting in 1817 he studied at the [[University of Jena]], attending the lectures of [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]], [[Heinrich Luden]] and [[Lorenz Oken]] and joining further Burschenschaften. Sand was among the nationalist students who gathered at the 1817 [[Wartburg festival]], in which Kotzebue's ''History of the German Empires'' was one of the [[book burning|books ceremoniously burned]].

===Murder of August von Kotzebue===
[[File:Ermordung August von Kotzebues.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Sand's attack on Kotzebue.]]
Sand already contemplated the murder of [[August von Kotzebue]] in a diary entry of 5 May 1818. He called him a "traitor to the nation" and a "deceiver of the people" and characterized him as an enemy of the Burschenschaft.

On the morning of 23 March 1819 Sand, using the pseudonym Henry, visited Kotzebue in his Mannheim house. Refused entry to the house and told to return in the afternoon, Sand returned just before five o'clock. Having exchanged just a few words with Kotzebue, Sand produced a dagger and, with the words "Here, you traitor to the fatherland!", stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Surprised by Kotzebue's four-year-old son witnessing the event from the nursery, Sand lost his wits and stabbed himself. Leaving the house, he handed a servant a piece of writing he had prepared ''("Death to August von Kotzebue")'', and stabbed himself again in the street. His suicide attempt failed, and he was taken to hospital.

==Aftermath==
The Mannheim ''Hofgericht'' (court of law) sentenced Sand to death on 5 May 1820. He was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by [[Franz Wilhelm Widmann]], who was the [[executioner|official executioner]] at the time.
[[File:Sands Hinrichtung.png|thumb|The execution of Karl Ludwig Sand.]]
[[File:Klsand-Grab.JPG|thumb|200px|His grave in Mannheim]]
Sand's murder of Kotzebue was a catalyst for government restrictions on liberal and German nationalist thought. On 20 September 1819 [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]] called a meeting of representatives from across the [[German Confederation]] to create the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] which outlawed the Burschenschaften and put limits on freedom of the press and the rights of members of such organizations, banning them from public office, teaching or studying at universities.&lt;ref name=Carlsbad&gt;[http://www.milestonedocuments.com/documents/full-text/carlsbad-decrees Full text of Carlsbad Decrees]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Dumas, père]] wrote about Sand's life and published excerpts from his journals and letters in ''Karl Ludwig Sand'',&lt;ref name=Dumas&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2745 ''Karl Ludwig Sand''] by Alexandre Dumas, père&lt;/ref&gt; part of ''Celebrated Crimes''.&lt;ref name=Crimecelebre&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2760 ''Celebrated Crimes''], Alexandre Dumas, père&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to writing his story, Dumas visited Widmann's son in [[Mannheim]] in 1838 to gather information about Sand's character. [[Alexander Pushkin]] also memorialized Sand in his poem about assassins entitled "Kinzhal" (The Dagger).&lt;ref name=Terras&gt;Terras, Victor, ''Handbook of Russian literature By Victor Terras'' page 96&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany three films have been made concerning the events of Karl Sand's life: ''Karl Sand'' in 1964, ''Sand'' in 1971, and ''Die Unbedingten'' in 2009.

'''Daniel Edgar Sickles''' (October 20, 1819{{spaced ndash}}May 3, 1914) was an American politician, soldier, and diplomat.

Born to a wealthy family in [[New York City]], Sickles was involved in a number of scandals, most notably the public slaying of his wife's lover, [[Philip Barton Key II]], a U.S. Attorney and son of [[Francis Scott Key]], whom Sickles gunned down in broad daylight in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], across the street from the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{cite news|title=Assassination of Philip Barton Key, by Daniel E. Sickles of New York |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/824716112.html?dids=824716112:824716112&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+01,+1859&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Assassination+of+Philip+Barton+Key,+by+Daniel+E.+Sickles+of+New+York&amp;pqatl=google|quote=For more than a year there have been floating rumors of improper intimacy between Mr. Key and Mrs. Sickles. They have from time to time attended parties, the opera, and rode out together. Mr. Sickles has heard of these reports, but would never credit them until Thursday evening last. On that evening, just as a party was about breaking up at his house, Mr Sickles received among his papers...|work=[[Hartford Daily Courant]]|date=March 1, 1859|accessdate=November 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquitted after using [[temporary insanity]] as a legal defense for the first time in United States history. This became a defense associated with 'crimes of passion' (''crime passionnel'' in French).

Upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, Sickles became one of the war's most prominent [[political general]]s, recruiting the New York regiments that became known as the [[Excelsior Brigade]] in the [[Army of the Potomac]]. Despite his lack of military experience, he served as a brigade, division, and corps commander in some of the early [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern campaigns]]. His military career ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, after he moved his [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] (without orders) to an untenable position where it was virtually destroyed. He was wounded by cannon fire and had to have his leg amputated. He was eventually awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Sickles|url=http://www.cmohs.org/recipient-detail/1244/sickles-daniel-e.php|website=Congressional Medal of Honor Society|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickles devoted considerable effort to trying to gain credit for helping achieve the Union victory at Gettysburg, writing articles and testifying before Congress in a manner that denigrated the intentions and actions of his superior officer, the army commander, Maj. Gen. [[George Meade|George G. Meade]]. After the war, Sickles was appointed as a commander for military districts in the South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He also served as [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Minister to Spain]]. Later he was re-elected to Congress, where he helped pass legislation to preserve the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/dan-sickles-preservationist The Battlefield Preservationist ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and politics==
In 1819, Sickles was born in [[New York City]] to Susan Marsh Sickles and George Garrett Sickles, a patent lawyer and politician.&lt;ref name=Beckman84&gt;Beckman, p. 1784.&lt;/ref&gt; (His year of birth is sometimes given as 1825, and Sickles was known to have claimed as such. Historians speculate that Sickles chose to appear younger when he married a woman half his age.) He learned the printer's trade and studied at the University of the City of New York (now [[New York University]]).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Sickles, Daniel Edgar|volume=25|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law in the office of [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin Butler]], was admitted to the bar in 1846, and was elected as a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co.) in [[70th New York State Legislature|1847]].&lt;ref name=Beckman84/&gt;

On September 27, 1852, Sickles married [[Teresa Bagioli Sickles|Teresa Bagioli]] against the wishes of both families&amp;mdash;he was 32, she about 15 or 16.&lt;ref&gt;Keneally, p. 21, states 15. W.A. Swanberg, ''Sickles the Incredible'', pp. 77-80 states 16. Relying in part on Swanberg, 77-80 and in part on other sources, Hessler, pp. 4-6 says 16. Teresa's exact birth date in 1836 is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; She was reported as sophisticated for her age, speaking five languages.

In 1853 Sickles became [[corporation counsel]] of New York City, but resigned soon afterward when appointed as secretary of the U.S. [[legation]] in London, under [[James Buchanan]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; by appointment of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. In 1855 he returned to the United States, and in 1856 he was elected as a member of the [[New York State Senate]] in the [[79th New York State Legislature|3rd D.]]. He was re-elected to the seat in [[80th New York State Legislature|1857]]. In 1856 he was also elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the [[35th United States Congress|35th U. S. Congress]], and held office  from March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1861, a total of two terms.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Homicide of Key===
[[File:Sickles homicide.jpg|thumb|left|Sickles shoots Key in 1859]]
Sickles was censured by the [[New York State Assembly]] for escorting a known prostitute, [[Fanny White]], into its chambers. He also reportedly took her to England, while leaving his pregnant wife at home. He presented White to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], using as her alias the surname of a New York political opponent.&lt;ref name=Beckman84/&gt;

On February 27, 1859, in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]], across the street from the [[White House]], Sickles shot and killed [[Philip Barton Key II]], the [[district attorney]] of the [[District of Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;Keneally, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and the son of [[Francis Scott Key]]. Sickles had discovered that Philip Key was having an affair with his young wife.&lt;ref name=key/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagg62&gt;Tagg, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickles surrendered at [[Attorney General]] [[Jeremiah Black]]'s house, a few blocks away on [[Franklin Square (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin Square]], and confessed to the [[murder]]. After a visit to his home, accompanied by a constable, Sickles was taken to jail.  He received numerous perquisites, including being allowed to retain his personal weapon, and receive numerous visitors.  So many visitors came that he was granted the use of the head jailer's apartment to receive them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assumption.edu/dept/history/Hi113net/sickles/default2.html Sickles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915162255/http://www.assumption.edu/dept/history/Hi113net/sickles/default2.html |date=2006-09-15 }}, Assumption College&lt;/ref&gt; They included many congressmen,  senators, and other leading members of Washington society. President [[James Buchanan]] sent Sickles a personal note.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:HarpersMagazineSicklesTrial.jpg|left|thumb|The trial of Sickles. Engraving from ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.]]
''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' reported that the visits of his wife's mother and her clergyman were painful for Sickles. Both told him that Teresa was distracted with grief, shame, and sorrow, and that the loss of her wedding ring (which Sickles had taken on visiting his home) was more than Teresa could bear.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Sickles was charged with murder. He secured several leading politicians as defense attorneys, among them [[Edwin M. Stanton]], later to become [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], and Chief Counsel [[James T. Brady]] who, like Sickles, was associated with [[Tammany Hall]].{{cn|date=February 2020}} Sickles pleaded temporary insanity&amp;mdash;the first use of this defense in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| last1 = Stankowski | first1 = J.

The papers soon trumpeted that Sickles was a hero for "saving all the ladies of Washington from this rogue named Key".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/Harper%27sNoSympathyNeeded.jpg Editorial: "No sympathy needed"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520012233/http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/Harper%27sNoSympathyNeeded.jpg |date=2006-05-20 }}, ''Harpers Magazine'', 12 March 1859&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickles had obtained a graphic confession from Teresa; it was ruled inadmissible in court, but, was leaked by him to the press and printed in the newspapers in full. The defense strategy ensured that the trial was the main topic of conversations in Washington for weeks, and the extensive coverage of national papers was sympathetic to Sickles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/Harper%27sNoSympathyNeeded.jpg Assumption.edu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520012233/http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/Harper%27sNoSympathyNeeded.jpg |date=2006-05-20 }}: "Both Harper's Weekly and Leslie's ran images of Sickles in prison. Harper's was the more bathetic. It showed a haggard sufferer, hands clasped as if in prayer, staring upwards. Light illumines his face and the wall immediately behind, but the rest of the cell is in shadows. Its title was 'Hon. Daniel E. Sickles in prison at Washington,' but it might well have been captioned 'More Sinned Against Than Sinning.' In a later issue, the magazine editorialized against what it described as a publicity campaign to create sympathy for the Congressman. ... ''[[The New York Times]]'', the city's other major Democratic daily and the [[New York Herald|New York Herald's]] chief rival for the ear of the Buchanan administration, editorialized that the homicide in no way unfitted the Congressman for office." The source gives many more such cites.&lt;/ref&gt; In the courtroom, the strategy brought drama, controversy, and, ultimately, an acquittal for Sickles.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}

Sickles publicly forgave Teresa, and "withdrew" briefly from public life, although he did not resign from Congress. The public was apparently more outraged by Sickles's forgiveness and reconciliation with his wife than by the murder and his unorthodox acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assumption.edu/acad/ii/Academic/history/Hi113net/sickles/VerdictEditorialMay7.jpg ''Harper's'' editorial on the verdict]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, May 7, 1859, in which they reject the insanity defense as essentially a sham and note that the prosecution did not try very hard.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s, Sickles had received a commission in the 12th Regiment of the New York Militia, and had attained the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sickles |first= Daniel E.|date= 1908 |title= The Union Army: States and Regiments, Volume II |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KFNLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22daniel+e+sickles%22+12th+regiment+major#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daniel%20e%20sickles%22%2012th%20regiment%20major&amp;f=false |publisher= Federal Publishing Company |page= 17|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He insisted on wearing his militia uniform for ceremonial occasions while serving in London, and caused a minor diplomatic scandal by snubbing [[Queen Victoria]] at an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Weintraub|first=Stanley|date=2011|title=Victorian Yankees at Queen Victoria's Court: American Encounters with Victoria and Albert |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zm58AkdWb-QC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=daniel+sickles+snub+queen+victoria#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20sickles%20snub%20queen%20victoria&amp;f=false|pages=81–83|isbn=9781611490619}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

{{Quote|At the outbreak of the Civil War, Sickles worked to repair his public image by raising volunteer units in New York for the [[Union Army]]. Because of his previous military experience and political connections, he was appointed [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of one (the [[70th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|70th New York Infantry]]) of the four regiments he organized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.archives.gov/id/66388430 Combined Military Service Record]&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers in September 1861, where he was notorious before beginning any fighting.

According to author Garry Boulard's ''Daniel Sickles: A Life,'' Sickles not only refused to return runaway slaves who escaped to his Union camp in Northern Virginia, he put many of them on the federal payroll as servants, while also training male slaves to be soldiers. It was a policy that won for him the approval of the influential Committee on the Conduct of the War.

In March 1862, he was forced to relinquish his command when the U.S. Congress refused to confirm his commission. He lobbied his Washington political contacts and reclaimed both his rank and his command on May 24, 1862, in time to rejoin the Army in the [[Peninsula Campaign]].&lt;ref name=Beckman84/&gt; Because of this interruption, Sickles missed his brigade's significant actions at the [[Battle of Williamsburg]]. Despite his lack of previous combat experience, he did a competent job commanding the "[[Excelsior Brigade]]" of the [[Army of the Potomac]] in the [[Battle of Seven Pines]] and the [[Seven Days Battles]]. He was absent for the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]],&lt;ref name=Tagg62/&gt; having used his political influences to obtain leave to go to New York City to recruit new troops. He also missed the [[Battle of Antietam]] because the [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]], to which he was assigned as a division commander, was stationed on the lower [[Potomac River|Potomac]], protecting the capital.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Sickles was a close ally of [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Joseph Hooker]], his original division commander, who eventually commanded the Army of the Potomac. Both men had notorious reputations as political climbers and as hard-drinking ladies' men. "Accounts at the time compared their army headquarters to a rowdy bar and bordello."

Sickles' division was in reserve at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. On January 16, 1863, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] nominated Sickles for promotion to the grade of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] to rank from November 29, 1862.&lt;ref name="Eicher705"&gt;Eicher, p. 705.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the U.S. Senate did not confirm the promotion until March 9, 1863, and the President did not formally appoint Sickles until March 11, 1863,&lt;ref name="Eicher705"/&gt; Hooker, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, gave Sickles command of the III Corps in February 1863.

This decision was controversial as Sickles became the only corps commander without a [[West Point]] military education. His energy and ability were conspicuous in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. He aggressively recommended pursuing troops he saw in his sector on May 2, 1863. Sickles thought the Confederates were retreating, but these turned out to be elements of [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's]] corps, stealthily marching around the Union flank. He also vigorously opposed Hooker's orders moving him off good defensive terrain in Hazel Grove. In both of these cases, it is easy to imagine the disastrous battle turning out very differently for the Union if Hooker had heeded his advice.|author=Charles Hanna|source=&lt;ref name="hanna"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanna|first1=Charles|title=Gettysburg Medal of Honor recipients|date=2010|publisher=Bonneville Books|location=Springville, Utah|isbn=9781599553023|pages=134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Gettysburg===

]]
The [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was the occasion of the most famous incident and the effective end of Sickles' military career. On July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] ordered Sickles' corps to take up defensive positions on the southern end of [[Cemetery Ridge]], anchored in the north to the [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] and to the south, the hill known as [[Little Round Top]]. Sickles was unhappy to see the "Peach Orchard," a slightly higher terrain feature, to his front. He violated orders by marching his corps almost a mile in front of Cemetery Ridge. This had two effects: it greatly diluted the concentrated defensive posture of his corps by stretching it too thin, and it created a salient that could be bombarded and attacked from multiple sides. About this time (3 p.m.), Meade called a meeting of his corps commanders.&lt;ref name="DEicher524"&gt;[[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]] ''The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War.'' New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001. {{ISBN|0-684-84944-5}}. p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; Sickles did not appear.&lt;ref name="DEicher524" /&gt; An aide to Brig. Gen. [[Gouverneur K. Warren]] soon reported the situation.&lt;ref name="DEicher524" /&gt; Meade and Warren rode to Sickles' position, where Meade demanded an explanation from the general.&lt;ref name="DEicher524" /&gt; Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw because he realized it was too late&lt;ref name="McPherson657"&gt;McPherson, p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Confederates would soon attack, putting a retreating force in even greater peril.&lt;ref name="DEicher524" /&gt;

The Confederates attacked at about the time the meeting finished and Meade returned to his headquarters.&lt;ref name="DEicher524"/&gt; The Confederate assault by [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s corps, primarily by the division of Maj. Gen. [[Lafayette McLaws]], smashed the III Corps and rendered it useless for further combat. Gettysburg campaign historian Edwin B. Coddington assigns "much of the blame for the near disaster" in the center of the Union line to Sickles.&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen W. Sears]] wrote that "Dan Sickles, in not obeying Meade's explicit orders, risked both his Third Corps and the army's defensive plan on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sickles' maneuver has recently been credited by [[John Keegan]] with blunting the whole Confederate offensive that was intended to cause the collapse of the Union line.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[James M. McPherson]] wrote that "Sickles's unwise move may have unwittingly foiled Lee's hopes."&lt;ref name="McPherson657"/&gt;

During the height of the Confederate attack, Sickles was wounded by a cannonball that mangled his right leg. He was carried by a detail of soldiers to the shade of the Trostle farmhouse, where a saddle strap was applied as a tourniquet. He ordered his aide, Major Harry Tremain, "Tell General [[David B. Birney|Birney]] he must take command." As Sickles was carried by stretcher to the III Corps hospital on the Taneytown Road, he attempted to raise his soldiers' spirits by grinning and puffing on a cigar along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Keneally, pp. 287-88.&lt;/ref&gt; His leg was amputated that afternoon. He insisted on being transported to [[Washington, D.C.]], which he reached on July 4, 1863. He brought some of the first news of the great Union victory, and started a public relations campaign to defend his behavior in the conflict. On the afternoon of July 5, President Lincoln and his son, Tad, visited General Sickles, as he was recovering in Washington.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Sickles leg.jpg|thumb|right|Sickles's leg, along with a cannonball similar to the one that shattered it, on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine]]
Sickles had recent knowledge of a new directive from the Army Surgeon General to collect and forward "specimens of morbid anatomy ... together with projectiles and foreign bodies removed" to the newly founded [[National Museum of Health and Medicine|Army Medical Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He preserved the bones from his leg and donated them to the museum in a small coffin-shaped box, along with a visiting card marked, "With the compliments of Major General D.E.S." For several years thereafter, he reportedly visited the limb on the anniversary of the amputation. The museum, now known as the [[National Museum of Health and Medicine]], still displays this artifact. (Other Civil War-era specimens of note on display include the hip of General [[Henry Barnum]].)

Sickles ran a vicious campaign against General Meade's character after the Civil War. Sickles felt that Meade had wronged him at Gettysburg and that credit for winning the battle belonged to him. In anonymous newspaper articles and in testimony before a congressional committee, Sickles maintained that Meade had secretly planned to retreat from Gettysburg on the first day. While his movement away from Cemetery Ridge may have violated orders, Sickles always asserted that it was the correct move because it disrupted the Confederate attack, redirecting its thrust, and effectively shielding the Union's real objectives, Cemetery Ridge and [[Cemetery Hill]]. Sickles's redeployment took Confederate commanders by surprise, and historians have argued about its ramifications ever since.

Sickles eventually received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions, although it took him 34 years to get it. The official citation accompanying his medal recorded that Sickles "displayed most conspicuous gallantry on the field, vigorously contesting the advance of the enemy and continuing to encourage his troops after being himself severely wounded."&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, p. 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his one-legged disability, Sickles remained in the army until the end of the war and was disgusted that Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] would not allow him to return to a combat command. In 1867, he received appointments as [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general and major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his services at Fredericksburg and Gettysburg, respectively.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Soon after the close of the Civil War, in 1865, he was sent on a confidential mission to [[Colombia]] (the "special mission to the South American Republics") to secure its compliance with a treaty agreement of 1846 permitting the United States to convey troops across the [[Isthmus of Panama]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; From 1865 to 1867, he commanded the [[Department of South Carolina]], the [[Department of the Carolinas]], the [[Department of the South]], and the [[Second Military District]]. Sickles pursued reconstruction on a basis of fair treatment for African-Americans and respect for the rights of employees. He halted foreclosures on property. He also made the wages of farm laborers the first lien on crops. He outlawed discrimination against African-Americans and banned the production of whisky.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Eliot Morrison. ''The Oxford History of the American People'' p. 717&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, he was appointed colonel of the 42nd U.S. Infantry ([[Veteran Reserve Corps]]), and in 1869 he was retired with the rank of major general.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Sickles served as [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Minister to Spain]] from 1869 to 1874, after the Senate failed to confirm [[Henry Shelton Sanford]] to the post, and took part in the negotiations growing out of the [[Virginius Affair]]. His inaccurate and emotional messages to Washington promoted war, until he was overruled by Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] and the war scare died out.

In his ''Daniel Sickles: A Life'' Garry Boulard points out that Sickles was disadvantaged throughout the Virginius controversy, trying to negotiate with a Spanish leadership that was frequently disorganized and chaotic, while the substantial talks were taking place in Washington between Fish and Spanish Minister Don Jose Polo de Barnabe. Even so, when Sickles subsequently decided to turn in his resignation, Fish, who was not displeased with Sickles' service, wired the General: "You are recalled on your own request." &lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Bradford, ''The Virginius Affair''(1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sickles maintained his reputation as a ladies' man in the Spanish royal court and was rumored to have had an affair with the deposed Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]]. Following the death of Teresa in 1867, in 1871 he married Carmina Creagh, the daughter of Chevalier de Creagh of Madrid, a Spanish Councillor of State. They had two children.

Sickles was appointed as president of the [[New York State Board of Civil Service Commissioners]] from 1888 to 1889, [[Sheriff of New York County, New York|Sheriff of New York County]] in 1890. He was elected again as a representative in the [[53rd Congress]], serving from 1893 to 1895. For most of his postwar life, he was the chairman of the [[New York Monuments Commission]], but he was forced out when $27,000 was found to have been [[embezzled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seeks To Wipe Out Sickles Commission.

He had an important part in efforts to preserve the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]], sponsoring legislation to form the [[Gettysburg National Military Park]], buy up private lands, and erect monuments. He procured the original fencing used on East Cemetery Hill to mark the park's borders. This fencing came directly from [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/on-the-homefront/battlefield-reservation/dan-sickles-the-battlefield.html|title=Dan Sickles/The Battlefield Preservationist|author=James Hessler|publisher=civilwar.org|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/dsickles.htm|title=Daniel Edgar Sickles, Major General United States Army/From a contemporary news report|publisher=arlingtoncemetery.net|accessdate=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the principal senior generals who fought at Gettysburg, virtually all, with the conspicuous exception of Sickles, have been memorialized with statues.  When asked why there was no memorial to him, Sickles supposedly said, "The entire battlefield is a memorial to Dan Sickles." The monument to the New York Excelsior Brigade was originally commissioned to include a bust of Sickles, but it includes a figure of an eagle instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Death==
Sickles lived out the remainder of his life in [[New York City]], dying on May 3, 1914 at the age of 94. His funeral was held at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Manhattan on May 8, 1914. He was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crowds Bare Heads At Sickles Funeral.

{{short description|Assassin of King George I of Greece}}
[[Image:Aleksandar Schinas.jpg|thumb|Alexandros Schinas]]'''Alexandros Schinas''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Σχινάς}}, c. 1870 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1913), also known as '''Aleko Schinas''', assassinated [[George I of Greece|King George I of Greece]] in 1913. Schinas has been variously portrayed as either an anarchist with political motivations ([[propaganda by deed]]), or a madman, but the historical record is inconclusive. The details of the assassination itself are known: on March 18, 1913, several months after [[Thessaloniki]]'s liberation from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[First Balkan War]], King George I was out for a late afternoon walk in the city, and, as was his custom, lightly guarded. Encountering George on the street near the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]], Schinas shot the king once in the back from close range with a revolver, killing him. Schinas was arrested and tortured. He claimed to have acted alone, blaming his actions on [[delirium]] brought on by [[tuberculosis]]. After several weeks in custody, Schinas died by falling out of a police station window, either by murder or by suicide.

The details of Schinas's life before the assassination are unclear. He was a native Greek but his birthplace is disputed, likely either in the area of [[Volos]] or [[Serres]]. His occupation is also unconfirmed. Several years before the assassination, Schinas may have left Greece for New York City, returning in February 1913. Some contemporary sources reported that he advocated anarchism or socialism, and ran an anarchist school that was shut down by the Greek government. Other sources claim he was mentally ill, a foreign agent, or held a grudge against the king. Since his death, his true motivations have been the subject of much dispute.

Very little is confirmed about Schinas's life before he assassinated King George I.{{sfn|Kemp|2018|p=179|ps=: "Little is known of Schinas' life before the assassination."}} He was born in the 1870s, possibly in [[Volos]],{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913e}} [[Serres]],{{sfn | Tomai | 2012}} or [[Kanalia]].{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913f}} He had two sisters, one older and one younger, and may have had a brother named Hercules who ran a chemist shop in Volos, where Schinas may have worked as an assistant. Schinas told an interviewer that he suffered from an unspecified "neurological condition" beginning at age 14.{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=178–179}} Schinas may have studied or taught medicine in Athens, possibly at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]]. After leaving Athens, Schinas and his sisters taught in the Greek village [[Kleisoura, Kastoria|Kleisoura]] before a dispute with his older sister forced him to resign. Schinas then moved to [[Xanthi]] and practiced medicine without authorization until stopped by authorities.{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=179–180}}

[[Image:Serres Orta Carsi Ottoman Postcard.jpg|alt=A photograph; see caption for description|thumb|The Orta Çarşı (Central Market) in Serres, then an Ottoman town known as Serez, c.1915. The domed-roof building seen in the background now houses the [[Archaeological Museum of Serres]].]]
Schinas's life after Xanthi is the subject of some dispute. Demetrios Botassi, the Greek consul general for New York in 1913, and other New York Greeks, told ''The New York Times'' that Schinas moved to Volos to open a school called the Centre for Workingmen with a doctor and a lawyer. The school was closed down by the government within months for "teaching anti-government ideas", and the doctor and lawyer were sentenced to three months in prison. For reasons unknown, Schinas was not punished. According to Botassi, during this period, Schinas also stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the office of deputy from Volos in the Greek legislative body.{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018 | 1p=180 | The New York Times | 1913c}}

Botassi's account was disputed by Bazil Batznoulis in a letter to ''Atlantis'', a Greek paper in New York, which was republished by ''The New York Times'' shortly after the assassination. Batznoulis claimed that Schinas was born in Kanalia, not Volos. According to Batznoulis's letter, it was not Alexandros Schinas who ran for office in Volos, but another person named George Schinas. Batznoulis disputed that Alexandros Schinas was involved in the Centre for Workingmen school in Volos, writing: "Schinas had nothing to do with any school and had no idea of entering politics. He was known as a man who loved isolation and his backgammon. He wore a beard and was an anarchist."{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018 | 1p=180 | The New York Times | 1913f}}
[[File:Dimitriados Street Volos Greece 1909.jpg|alt=A photograph; see caption for description|left|thumb|Dimitriados Street, Volos, Greece, c.1907]]

In the years prior to the assassination, Schinas reportedly lived in [[New York City]] and worked at the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]] and [[Plaza Hotel]]. Schinas stated in a 1913 interview that in 1910, he was deported from Thessaloniki (then under Ottoman rule) by the [[Young Turks]] "because I was a good Greek patriot".{{sfn | Magrini | 1913 | p=185}} Botassi suggested another explanation for Schinas's departure to the US: that he was evading the police following the closure of the Centre for Workingmen school in Volos. Batznoulis, on the other hand, wrote that Schinas left because of a family quarrel with his brother Hercules.{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=180–181}}

No known immigration or other records document Schinas's deportation from Thessaloniki or arrival in New York in 1910. However, immigration records document the arrival of a 36-year-old man named Athanasios Schinas (approximately the same age as Alexandros Schinas would have been at the time), a former resident of [[Kalavryta]], Greece, arriving at [[Ellis Island]] aboard the ship ''La Gascogne'' from [[Le Havre]], France on October 30, 1905. It is unclear whether Athanasios Schinas was the same person as Alexandros, or whether Alexandros travelled under an assumed name to avoid detection by Greek authorities.{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=180–181}} In apparent contrast to reports of his emigration in 1910, a 1913 article in ''The New York Times'' reported that Schinas was still in Greece in 1911, stating that he applied that year for assistance at the king's palace but was refused and driven off by palace guards.{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018 | 1p=181–182 | The New York Times | 1913e}}

Although it is uncertain when, why, or even whether he moved to New York City, Schinas was back in Greece by February 1913. According to post-assassination newspaper articles, about three weeks before the assassination, he traveled from Athens to Volos, then to Thessaloniki, possibly subsisting by begging. In an interview while in custody, Schinas stated that some weeks prior the assassination, he had contracted [[tuberculosis]], and a few days before the assassination, he was suffering from "severe high fevers" and "deliriums", and "was being taken over by madness".{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018 | 1p=182| The New York Times | 1913e}}{{clear}}

It is reported that in a private conversation with the king's widow, Queen Olga, he stated that he had acted alone, but most historians take the view that he acted on behalf of foreign interests in the Balkans that benefited from the king's murder."&lt;/ref&gt; Schinas shot George once in the back at point-blank range with a seven-cylinder revolver.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | The New York Times | 1913e }}; {{harvnb | Norwich Bulletin | 1913 }}

However, George's biographer, Walter Christmas, wrote in the king's biography that "the last words that left the King's lips" were: "Thank God, Christmas can now finish his work with a chapter to the glory of Greece, of the Crown Prince and of the Army." {{harv|Christmas|1914|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Schinas had "lurked in hiding" and "rushed out" to shoot George.{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913e}} Another version described Schinas emerging from a Turkish cafe called the "Pasha Liman", drunk and "ragged", and shooting the king when he walked by.{{sfnm | Ashdown | 2011 | 1p=185 | Christmas | 1914 | 2p=406–407}} Schinas did not attempt to escape afterwards and Frangoudis immediately apprehended him.

== Death ==
[[File:Alekos Schinas Arrested.jpg|thumb|Schinas in custody]]
Schinas was tortured or "forced to undergo examinations" while in gendarmerie custody.{{refn | name=torture |
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=183 | ps=: "During his detention Schinas was 'forced to undergo examinations, which failed to elicit any facts to show that other persons were implicated.' One can only imagine what such examinations entailed, but given the popularity of his victim and the oppressive nature of the Greek gendarmerie, it is highly probable that coercion, physical torture and beatings were liberally applied to Schinas by largely conservative and militarized gendarmes of the day.

On May 6, 1913, six weeks after being arrested, Schinas died by falling {{convert|30|ft|m|spell=on|abbr=off|0}} out of a window from the office of the Examining Magistrate of the gendarmerie in Thessaloniki. He was approximately 43 years old.{{refn|{{harvnb | Magrini | 1913 | p=185 | ps=: "I am now forty-three!"}}}} The gendarmerie reported that Schinas, who was not handcuffed at the time, ran and jumped out of the window when the guards were distracted.{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913g}} Some suggest Schinas may have committed suicide to avoid further gendarmerie "examinations" or a slow death from tuberculosis; others speculate that he was thrown from the window by the gendarmerie.{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018| 1p=183 | Newton | 2014}} Greek newspaper ''Kathimerini'' has reported that Schinas gave [[deposition (law)|deposition]]s before his death, but they were lost in a fire aboard a ship while being transported.{{sfn | Kathimerini | 2006 }} After his death, his ear and hand were amputated and used for identification, then stored and exhibited at the Criminology Museum of Athens.{{sfnm | Kemp | 2018| 1p=183}}{{clear}}

=== Political ===

Schinas has been described as an anarchist{{r|anarchist}} and a socialist.{{refn | name=socialist |
* {{harvnb | Newton | 2014 | p=179 | ps=: "On March 18, 1913, while strolling unguarded near the White Tower of Thessaloniki, King George was shot in the back at close range and killed instantly by Alexandros Schinas, described in press reports as a member of an unnamed 'Socialist organization.'"}}

* {{harvnb | Schurman | 1913 | ps=: "Reports that King George was shot and killed this afternoon at Saloniki. While walking with an aide de camp a Greek socialist shot him through the heart from behind a wall."}}
* {{harvnb | The New York Times | 1913 | ps=: "Said to be a Socialist–Declares After Arrest He Is Against Governments."}}}} The March 19, 1913, initial report of George's assassination in ''The New York Times'' described Schinas as "a Socialist" who declared that "he is against governments". However, it also described him as a "feeble intellect" and "of low mental type", "who states that he was driven to desperation by sickness and want", concluding: "The crime, therefore, was without motive."{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913}}
[[Image:Shotwhile.png|thumb|right|March 19, 1913 ''New York Times'' headline describing Schinas as a "socialist"]]
The following day, ''The New York Times'' published an article from its Baltimore and New York bureaus, quoting three witnesses. The first was Eratosthemus Charrns, a waiter who said he worked with Schinas at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York and who described Schinas as a "socialist", a "communist", a "radical", and an "atheist". The second was the Greek consul general for New York, Demetrios Botassi, who told the newspaper that Schinas was a "man of education", an "anarchist", and an "atheist", according to "Greeks who knew him well".{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913c}} The same day, ''The New York Times'' published a statement from the Greek Minister in London that Schinas was "a victim of alcoholism" and that "the assassination cannot be ascribed to any political motive".{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913d}}
[[Image:Alekos King's Murderer.png|thumb|right|March 20, 1913 ''New York Times'' headline describing Schinas as an "anarchist"]]
A third article published in the March 20, 1913 ''New York Times'' stated that Schinas "is not a madman, but apparently is weak-minded", and that he "led a wretched existence, subsisting almost entirely on milk". According to the article, Schinas visited Volo shortly before the assassination and "declared that in a short time he would succeed in establishing equality; that there would no longer be either rich or poor, and that work which was now accomplished in one hour would be spread out over two." The article stated that Schinas told interrogators he assassinated the king because, "I had to die somehow, as I suffer from [[neurasthenia]], and therefore wished to redeem my life."{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913e}}

On March 21, 1913, ''The New York Times'' published Batznoulis's letter to ''Atlantis'' generally disputing Botassi's earlier account (but nevertheless describing Schinas as an "anarchist"), along with a statement from Solon Vlasto, editor of ''Atlantis'', endorsing Batznoulis's account and suggesting that the many conflicting stories concerning Schinas's identity may be due to the fact that Schinas is a common surname in Greece and there were likely multiple people named "Aleko Schinas".{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913f}}

Schinas was interviewed in March 1913 and asked the question, "Are you an anarchist?" to which he replied:{{sfn | Magrini | 1913 | p=185}}
{{Quote|text=No, no! I am not an anarchist, but socialist. I become a socialist, when I was studying medicine in Athens. I do not know how. One becomes a socialist, without realising it, slowly (one step at a time). All people that are good and educated are socialist. The philosophy towards medicine, for me it was the socialism.}}

One recent scholar has doubted that Schinas was an anarchist or that his actions were an example of propaganda by deed.{{refn |
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=180 | ps=: "[Botassi] described Schinas as a 'man of education and a confirmed anarchist.' This allegation seems somewhat opposed to Schinas' own later protestations and those of others who shared his Socialist beliefs."}}
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=183 | ps=: "Regardless of the motivating factors that lay behind the regicide (which were almost certainly not, as commonly presumed, part of a wider campaign of propaganda of the deed), the consequences to Schinas were severe."}}
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=184 | ps=: "What is clear is that the understanding that Schinas acted as a motivated Anarchist attacker is inherently flawed."}}}} Writing in 2018, Michael Kemp noted that both "socialism" and "anarchism" were used interchangeably at the time, and that reports of Schinas as having run for political office or invested in a stock market do not support theories that Schinas was either a socialist or an anarchist.{{refn |
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=180 | ps=: "It is worth considering, however, that during the nineteenth century the terms 'Socialism' and 'Anarchism' were often used interchangeably. Although there is significant gulf between ideas of remodeling the state and those that aim to remove it altogether, many public figures and press reports of the time ignored this distinction; indeed, both Socialism and Anarchism were seen as a grave social and political threats in the public and media consciousness."}}
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=180 | ps=: "Also according to Botassi, it was during this period that Schinas unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the office of deputy from Volos for the Greek legislative body. This abortive attempt to join the ranks of the political class did not meet with success, but again, it hardly seems consistent with the actions of a supposed Anarchist radical."}}
* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=181 | ps=: "Although an inheritance may well have provided a reason for Schinas to return to Greece following his deportation, it seems unlikely that either a committed Socialist or an avowed Anarchist would invest funds in the unreservedly capitalist stock exchange."}}}}

Others have suggested the Schinas was a foreign agent&lt;ref name=ForeignAgent&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2018|p=182}} (Bulgaria or Ottoman Empire); {{harvnb|The National Herald|2017}} (Bulgaria, Germany, or Ottoman Empire); {{harvnb|Newton|2014|p=179}} (Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, or Germany); {{harvnb|Tomai|2012}} (Austria-Hungary); {{harvnb|Ashdown|2011|p=185}} (Macedonia); {{harvnb|Kathimerini|2006}} (Bulgaria, Germany, or Ottoman Empire); {{harvnb|Gallant|2001|p=129}} (Bulgaria); {{harvnb|Christmas|1914|pp=411–412}} (Bulgaria or Ottoman Empire); {{harvnb|UPI|1913}} (Ottoman Empire)&lt;/ref&gt; acting on behalf of Austria-Hungary,{{sfn | Tomai | 2012}} Bulgaria,{{refn |

But more persistent rumors spoke of a German plan to liquidate the pro-English king in order to promote German interests in Greece,' Zafeiris writes. 'One version, considered more likely than the rest, has it that the king was the victim of German diplomacy given that George's policy ran counter to German plans for the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

* {{harvnb | Kemp | 2018 | p=182 | ps=: "Another theory is that Schinas, rather than acting of his own volition, was actually acting on behalf of the Turks or the Bulgarians...This conspiracy theory explaining Schinas' actions has several parallels to those pertaining to the assassination of John F. Kennedy (a populist leader with a reduced security detail, supposedly assassinated by mysterious forces acting through a dupe), but its accuracy is questionable. Although many details of Schinas' life are presently unknown (and at the time of the regicide the atmosphere in Thessaloniki was doubtless tense), no evidence that Schinas was acting as an agent for the Ottoman Empire, the Bulgarians, or any other entity has emerged."}}
* {{harvnb | Newton | 2014 | p=179 | ps=: "Conspiracy theories linking Schinas to plotters from Bulgaria, Germany, or Austria-Hungary were never substantiated."}}

The result of the examination points to the assassin alone.

And the growth of the myth was encouraged by the circumstance that Alexander Skinas avoided further investigations by suicide."}}
* {{harvnb | UPI | 1913 | ps=: "No confirmation of this was forthcoming, though, and nothing developed in Saloniki to indicate the Turks had anything to do with the killing of the Greek king."}}}} The ''Norwich Bulletin'' reported that there were fears of Bulgarian involvement, "but a message received at midnight dispelled such apprehensions by identifying the assassin as a Greek degenerate".{{sfn | Norwich Bulletin | 1913}}

=== Personal ===
[[Image:Alekos Schinas Set.jpg|thumb|Schinas, 1913]]
Some have asserted that the motive for the assassination was revenge for the king's refusal of request for assistance in 1911, or simply that Schinas had lost an inherited fortune in the Greek stock market, was in poor health, and despondent prior to the attack.{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913e}}{{r|madman}} Schinas has been described as an alcoholic,{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913d}} "weak-minded",{{sfn | The New York Times | 1913e}} a "madman",{{r|madman}}  "irresponsible",{{sfn | Norwich Bulletin | 1913}} and of "unstable mind".{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=181}} The Greek government released statements claiming that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant.{{sfn | The Times | 1913}} ''The Rural New-Yorker'' stated: "It is believed that the assassin is mentally unbalanced, and that the crime was not the result of any political conspiracy."{{sfn | The Rural New-Yorker | 1913}} Other reports referred to him as "a man of education" or "an educated anarchist".{{sfnm | The Commercial and Financial Chronicle| 1913 | The New York Times | 1913c}}

In a 1913 interview after his arrest, Schinas himself blamed "deliriums" brought on by tuberculosis, saying:{{sfn | Magrini | 1913 | p=185}}

{{Quote|text=During the night I was waking up, like I was being taken over by madness. I wanted to destroy the world. I wanted to kill everybody, because the whole of society was my enemy. Luck wanted that during this psychological condition to meet the King. I would have killed my own sister if I had met her that day.}}

More than a year after Schinas's death, ''The New York Times'' printed a retrospective article regarding recent political assassinations. The article did not list Schinas among "anarchists who believe in militant tactics", instead describing George I's "murderer" as "a Greek named Aleko Schinas who probably was half demented".{{sfn | The New York Times | 1914}} A more recent scholar has written that, "Rather than being part of a wider conspiracy, whether political or enacted by a state, Alexandros Schinas may have simply been a sick man (both mentally and physically) seeking an escape from the harsh realities of the early twentieth century."{{sfn | Kemp | 2018 | p=184}} Another describes the gendarmerie's torture of Schinas as producing "a confused confession that mixed anarchist sentiments with a claim that 'he had killed the King because he refused to give him money.'"{{sfn | Newton | 2014 | p=179}} Some sources have described him simply as "a Greek named Aleko Schinas".{{sfn | Bradstreet | 1913}}

The motive has never been revealed nor has Schinas's testimony in depositions to authorities - a fire broke out on the steamship carrying them to Piraeus. It is reported that in a private conversation with the king's widow, Queen Olga, he stated that he had acted alone, but most historians take the view that he acted on behalf of foreign interests in the Balkans that benefited from the king's murder. «Immediately after the murder, the city was in uproar and rumors offered by Greeks blamed the scapegoats of the time, the Turks and Bulgarians. But more persistent rumors spoke of a German plan to liquidate the pro-English king in order to promote German interests in Greece,» Zafeiris writes. «One version, considered more likely than the rest, has it that the king was the victim of German diplomacy given that George's policy ran counter to German plans for the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The German rulers themselves wanted the pro-German successor Constantine, who identified with German policy in Greece, at the head of the Greek state.» The death of Schinas, who fell or was pushed out of a window at the military headquarters where he was being held, lent force to rumors and speculation about the real cause of the murder. | ref={{harvid | Kathimerini | 2006}} | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210041932/http://www.ekathimerini.com/45572/article/ekathimerini/news/four-famous-targets-of-assassination-in-salonica | archivedate=2018-12-09 | url-status=live}}

As a child growing up in the [[West Bank]], Sirhan was traumatized by the violence he witnessed in the Arab–Israeli conflict, including the death of his older brother, who was run over by a Jordanian military vehicle that was swerving to escape Israeli gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gorney |first1=Cynthia |title=Sirhan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/08/20/sirhan/75cd41f0-e570-4bc4-ac93-83f251eec765/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=20 August 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sirhan was 12 years old, his family emigrated to the US, moving briefly to New York and then to California. In [[Altadena, California|Altadena]], he attended [[Charles W. Eliot Middle School|Eliot Junior High School]], followed by [[John Muir High School (Pasadena, California)|John Muir High School]] and [[Pasadena City College]], both in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. Sirhan's father, Bishara, has been characterized as a stern man who often beat his sons harshly. Shortly after the family's move to California, Bishara returned alone to the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/kennedy/4.html Sirhan Sirhan profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230150731/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/kennedy/4.html |date=December 30, 2011 }} at TruTV.com&lt;/ref&gt; Standing {{convert|5|ft|5|in|cm}} and weighing {{convert|120|lb|kg}} at 20 years old, Sirhan moved to [[Corona, California|Corona]] to train to be a [[jockey]] while working at a stable, but lost his job and abandoned the pursuit after suffering a head injury in a racing accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ayton |first1=Mel |title=The Forgotten Terrorist: Sirhan Sirhan and the Assassination of Robert F.

{{Main|Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy}}
Around 12:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]] on June 5, 1968, Sirhan fired a [[.22 caliber]] [[Iver Johnson#Robert Kennedy assassination|Iver-Johnson Cadet]] revolver&lt;ref&gt;Witcover 1969, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Robert Kennedy]] and the crowd surrounding him in the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles shortly after Kennedy had finished addressing supporters in the hotel's main ballroom. Authors [[George Plimpton]], and [[Jimmy Breslin]] , former professional football player [[Rosey Grier]], and 1960 Olympic gold medalist [[Rafer Johnson]] were among several men who subdued and disarmed Sirhan after a struggle.

Kennedy was shot three times—once in the head and twice in the back—with a fourth bullet passing through his jacket. He died almost 26 hours later at [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]].

In a 2018 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]] said that he traveled to the Richard J. Donovan correctional facility in California to meet with Sirhan, and that after a relatively lengthy conversation (the details of which he would not disclose), believed that Sirhan did not kill his father and that a second gunman was involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/05/26/who-killed-bobby-kennedy-his-son-rfk-jr-doesnt-believe-it-was-sirhan-sirhan/|title=Who killed Bobby Kennedy?

==Prosecution==
Despite the fact that Sirhan admitted his guilt in a recorded confession while in police custody on June 9, a lengthy, publicized trial followed in ''The People of the State of California v. Sirhan Sirhan''. The judge did not accept his confession and denied his request to withdraw his plea of "not guilty" in order to plead "guilty".&lt;ref name=LawJRank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3182/Sirhan-Bishara-Sirhan-Trial-1969-Murder-Plan.html |title=Sirhan Bishara Sirhan Trial: 1969 – A Murder Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1969, Sirhan's lawyers made a motion in chambers to enter a plea of guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. Sirhan told Judge Herbert V. Walker that he wanted to withdraw his original plea of not guilty in order to plead guilty as charged on all counts. He also asked that his counsel "dissociate themselves from this case completely." The judge asked him what he wanted to do about sentencing, and Sirhan replied, "I will ask to be executed."&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt; Walker denied the motion and said, "This court will not accept the plea." He also denied Sirhan's request for his counsel to withdraw; his counsel entered another motion to withdraw from the case of their own volition, but Walker denied that too.&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt; Walker subsequently ordered that the record be sealed pertaining to the motion.&lt;ref name="automatic_appeal"&gt;''People v. Sirhan'', 7 Cal. 3d 710, June 16, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial proceeded, and opening statements began on February 12. The lead prosecutor in the case was [[Lynn Compton|Lynn "Buck" Compton]], a [[World War II]] veteran of [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Easy Company]] fame who later became a justice of the California Court of Appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crimemagazine.com/04/bobbykennedy,0527.htm |title=Sirhan Sirhan: Assassin of Modern U.S. History by Denise Noe |publisher=Crimemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730051517/http://www.crimemagazine.com/04/bobbykennedy,0527.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Fitts delivered the prosecution's opening statement, providing examples of Sirhan's preparations to kill Kennedy. The prosecution showed that Sirhan was seen at the Ambassador Hotel on June 3, two nights before the attack, to learn the building's layout, and that he visited a gun range on June 4. Alvin Clark, Sirhan's garbage collector, testified that Sirhan had told him a month before the attack of his intention to shoot Kennedy.&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt;

Sirhan's defense counsel included attorney [[Grant Cooper (attorney)|Grant Cooper]], who had hoped to demonstrate that the killing had been the impulsive act of a man with a mental deficiency. But Walker admitted into evidence pages from three of the journal notebooks Sirhan had kept that showed the murder was premeditated and "quite calculating and willful."&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt; On March 3, Cooper asked Sirhan in direct testimony if he had shot Kennedy; Sirhan replied, "Yes, sir," but then said that he did not bear Kennedy any ill will.&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt; Sirhan also testified that he had killed Kennedy "with 20 years of [[malice aforethought]]." He explained in an interview with David Frost in 1989 that this referred to the time since the creation of the State of Israel. He has maintained since then that he has no memory of the crime, or of making that statement in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skoloff|first=Brian|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20030306-2018-ca-sirhanparole.html|title=Sirhan Sirhan denied parole for 12th time|publisher=Signonsandiego.com|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper asked Sirhan to explain his reasons for attacking Kennedy, and Sirhan launched into "a vicious diatribe about the Middle East conflict between Arab and Jew."&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishJournal&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/palestinian_terror_stretches_back_to_rfk_killing_at_the_ambassador_hotel_20|title=Palestinian terror stretches back to RFK| first=Paul | last=Kujawsky| work=The Jewish Journal|date=May 29, 2008|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defense counsel [[Emile Zola Berman]], who was Jewish, was upset by Sirhan's statements, and expressed his intention to resign from the defense team. Cooper eventually talked Berman out of resigning, and he stayed until the end of the trial.&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt;

The defense based its case primarily on the expert testimony of [[Bernard L. Diamond]], M.D., a professor of law and psychiatry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] who testified that Sirhan was suffering from [[diminished capacity]] at the time of the murder.&lt;ref name=Gach&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-21/news/mn-4578_1_bernard-diamond |title=Bernard Diamond; Expert on Psychiatry and the Law |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirhan was convicted on April 17, 1969, and was sentenced six days later to death in the gas chamber. Three years later, his sentence was commuted to life in prison, owing to the California Supreme Court's decision in ''[[People v. Anderson|The People of the State of California vs. Robert Page Anderson]]'', which ruled that capital punishment is a violation of the California Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The February 1972 decision was retroactive, invalidating all existing death sentences in California.&lt;ref name="automatic_appeal"/&gt;

===Appeals===
Sirhan's lawyer [[Lawrence Teeter]] later argued that Grant Cooper was compromised by a conflict of interest and was, as a consequence, grossly negligent in defense of his client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-info.com/teeter2.htm |title=Teeter Statement of June 5, 1998 |publisher=Jfk-info.com |date= |accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense moved for a new trial amid claims of setups, police bungles, [[hypnotism]], [[brainwashing]], blackmail, and government conspiracies.&lt;ref name=Jablon&gt;{{cite news| title=Attorney says Sirhan didn't kill Robert Kennedy| first=Robert |last=Jablon| work=Daily Breeze|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15682891.html| location=Los Angeles | date=June 6, 2003| accessdate=September 10, 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lota&gt;{{cite news|title=Killer of Sen.

Since 1994 Teeter had been trying to have state and federal courts overturn Sirhan's conviction, arguing his client was hypnotized and framed, possibly by a government conspiracy.&lt;ref name=Jablon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lota /&gt; During one hearing Teeter referred to testimony from the original trial transcripts regarding a prosecution eyewitness to the attack, author George Plimpton, in which he said that Sirhan looked "enormously composed. He seemed&amp;nbsp;... purged." This statement coincided with the defense's argument that Sirhan had shot Kennedy while in some kind of hypnotic trance.&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt; The motion was denied. Teeter died in 2005, and Sirhan declined other counsel to replace him.&lt;ref name=Wilmington&gt;{{cite news|work=Wilmington Morning Star|agency=Associated Press| title= Sirhan says liquor, anger led to killing| location=Los Angeles |date=September 27, 1980|accessdate=September 9, 2009 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v-UVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5527%2C5825541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2011, Sirhan's defense teams filed court papers for a new trial, saying that "expert analysis of recently uncovered evidence shows two guns were fired in the assassination and that Sirhan's revolver was not the gun that shot Kennedy"&lt;ref name="Convicted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Second Gunman"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=CNN | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/04/justice/california-rfk-second-gun/index.html?iref=obnetwork | title=Attorneys for RFK convicted killer Sirhan push 'second gunman' argument | date = March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryferrell.org/wiki/index.php/Robert_Kennedy_Assassination The Robert Kennedy Assassination].

On January 5, 2015, Sirhan's motion was denied by U.S. District Judge [[Beverly Reid O'Connell]] in Los Angeles, who said that Sirhan "failed to meet the showing required for actual innocence" that might excuse his having failed to seek his freedom sooner in federal court. In other words, Sirhan's case was not strong enough. "Though petitioner advances a number of theories regarding the events of June 5, 1968, petitioner does not dispute that he fired eight rounds of gunfire in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel", O'Connell wrote. "Petitioner does not show that it is more likely than not that no juror, acting reasonably, would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."

===Motives===
A motive cited for Sirhan's actions is the Middle East conflict.&lt;ref name=JewishJournal/&gt; After his arrest, Sirhan said, "I can explain it. I did it for my country."&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt; Sirhan believed that he was deliberately betrayed by Kennedy's support for Israel in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimemagazine.com/part-ii-why-sirhan-sirhan-assassinated-robert-kennedy|title=Part II: Why Sirhan Sirhan Assassinated Robert Kennedy by Mel Ayton|publisher=Crimemagazine.com|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had begun one year to the day before the assassination. During a search of Sirhan's apartment after his arrest, a spiral-bound notebook was found containing a diary entry that demonstrated that his anger had gradually fixated on Kennedy, who had promised to send 50 fighter jets to Israel if elected president. Sirhan's journal entry of May 18, 1968, read: "My determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th."&lt;ref name=LawJRank /&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishJournal /&gt; They found other notebooks and diary entries expressing his growing rage at Kennedy; his journals also contained many nonsensical scribbles that were thought to be his version of "[[free writing]]".

The next day, on June 6, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' printed an article by Jerry Cohen that discussed Sirhan's motive for the assassination, confirmed by the memos Sirhan wrote to himself. The article stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Jordanian nationalist, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, allegedly shot Kennedy, ostensibly because of the senator's advocacy of U.S. support for Israel, the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 6, 1968|accessdate=September 9, 2009|title=Yorty Reveals That Suspect's Memo Set Deadline for Death|first=Jerry | last= Cohen| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/512460622.html?dids=512460622:512460622&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+6%2C+1968&amp;author=JERRY+COHEN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281886-Current+File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=0_1&amp;desc=Yorty+Reveals+That+Suspect%27s+Memo+Set+Deadline+for+Death|page=Front Page|location=Los Angeles, Calif.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[M.T. Mehdi]], then secretary-general of the Action Committee on American-Arab Relations, believed that Sirhan had acted in justifiable self-defense, stating: "Sirhan was defending himself against those 50 [[Phantom jets|Phantom]] jets Kennedy was sending to Israel." Mehdi wrote a 100-page book on the subject called ''Kennedy and Sirhan: Why?''&lt;ref name=MTMehdi&gt;{{cite book|title= Kennedy and Sirhan: Why?| first=Mohammad Taki |last= Mehdi | work=New World Press|year=1968|isbn=0-911026-04-5|edition=Illustrated Paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9y6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q|pages=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in prison, Sirhan claimed that he was drunk. An interview with Sirhan in 1980 revealed new claims that a combination of liquor and anger over the anniversary of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war triggered his actions. "You must remember the circumstances of that night, June 5. That was when I was provoked," Sirhan says, recorded in a transcript of one of his interviews with Mehdi, later president of the New York-based American-Arab Relations Committee. "That is when I initially went to observe the Jewish Zionist parade in celebration of the June 5, 1967, victory over the Arabs. That was the catalyst that triggered me on that night." Then Sirhan said, "In addition, there was the consumption of the liquor, and I want the public to understand that."&lt;ref name=Wilmington /&gt;

==Imprisonment==

In 1971, Sirhan was housed in the Adjustment Center at [[San Quentin State Prison]].&lt;ref name=Yoemans&gt;{{cite news|last=Yoemans|first=Jeannine|title=San Quentin Story Unfolded; Officials Give Account of Escape Attempt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vItLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KiQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7056%2C5471921|accessdate=March 18, 2013|newspaper=The Press-Courier|date=August 24, 1971|agency=AP|location=Oxnard, California|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently transferred to the [[Correctional Training Facility]] (CTF) in [[Soledad, California]], where he was confined until 1992.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;Curtis, Kim.

On November 22, 2013, Sirhan was transferred from Corcoran to the [[Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility]] in [[San Diego County]]. The transfer occurred on the 50th anniversary of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], but a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said that the transfer was "a routine matter of housing allotments" and its timing was "simply an unfortunate coincidence".&lt;ref&gt;Monica Garske, [http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/22/21580708-rfk-killer-sirhan-sirhan-moved-to-another-prison-on-anniversary-of-jfk-assassination RFK killer Sirhan Sirhan moved to another prison — on anniversary of JFK assassination], NBCNews.com (November 22, 2013).

===Applications for parole===
In a 1980 interview with M. T. Mehdi, Sirhan claimed that his actions were fueled by liquor and anger. He then complained that the [[parole board]] was not taking these "mitigating" circumstances into account when they continually denied his parole.&lt;ref name=Wilmington /&gt;

On May 10, 1982, Sirhan told the parole board: "I sincerely believe that if Robert Kennedy were alive today, I believe he would not countenance singling me out for this kind of treatment. I think he would be among the first to say that, however horrible the deed I committed 14 years ago was, that it should not be the cause for denying me equal treatment under the laws of this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Carol|last=Oppenheim|title=RFK would OK parole, Sirhan says|work=Chicago Tribune|page=9|date=May 11, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sirhan denied parole for 10th time in RFK killing" by Steve Wilstein. ''Daily Breeze'' (Torrance, CA), May 24, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A parole hearing for Sirhan is now scheduled every five years. On March 2, 2011, after 42 years in prison, Sirhan's 14th parole hearing was held, with Sirhan represented by his current attorney, [[William Francis Pepper]]. At this hearing, Sirhan testified that he continues to have no memory of the assassination nor of any details of his 1969 trial and confession. Pepper also repeated the claim Sirhan's lawyers had previously made that Sirhan was "hypno-programmed" and his memory of being programmed was "wiped" by an unknown conspiracy behind the assassination. Pepper said he hired Daniel Brown of Harvard Medical School to spend more than 60 hours with Sirhan in prison and recover his memory of both the shooting and having been put under hypnosis. His parole was denied on the grounds that Sirhan still does not understand the full ramifications of his crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/us/03brfs-SIRHANSIRHAN_BRF.html?_r=1|title=California: Sirhan Sirhan Denied Parole|date=March 2, 2011| work= The New York Times|first=Ian|last=Lovett}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sirhan Sirhan in 2016.jpg|thumb|Sirhan Sirhan on February 9, 2016, the day before his 15th parole hearing.]]

On February 10, 2016, at his 15th parole hearing, Sirhan was denied parole again. One of Sirhan's shooting victims from that night, Paul Schrade, now aged 91, testified in support of Sirhan, stating his belief that a second shooter killed Kennedy and that Sirhan was intended to be a distraction from the real gunman by an unknown conspiracy.&lt;ref name="WaPo2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/02/10/this-kennedy-confidant-has-spent-decades-calling-for-the-release-of-rfks-killer/?tid=sm_fb|title=Sirhan Sirhan denied parole despite a Kennedy confidant's call for the assassin's release|date=February 11, 2016| work= The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Holley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/robert-kennedy-assassin-sirhan-sirhan-denied-parole-official-425598 |title=Robert Kennedy assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, denied parole: official |date=February 11, 2016 |agency=Reuters |newspaper=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schrade2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article44184.htm |title=Man Shot Alongside RFK Say Sirhan Sirhan Should Be Granted Parole |author=Steve Fiorina |date=February 11, 2016 |work=Information Clearing House }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirhan also repeated his claim to have no memory of the shooting. In his testimony before the parole board, Sirhan recalled events before the shooting in some detail – going to a shooting range the day before, June 4, 1968, visiting the hotel on June 5 in search of a party and returning to the lobby after realizing he had drunk too many [[Tom Collins]] cocktails to drive. He next claimed to have drunk coffee in a backstage area near the hotel pantry with a woman to whom he was attracted, and who may have been involved with the conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. Brown has stated that the unknown woman then took Sirhan into the pantry, which Sirhan described in his prison memory sessions as a dark room at the hotel, and that while in the pantry the woman gave Sirhan a post-hypnotic cue to fire a gun in Kennedy's direction minutes later. Sirhan was immediately subdued by several men in the pantry as Kennedy fell to the floor fatally wounded. Sirhan has claimed that after having coffee with the woman, the next thing he can remember is being choked and unable to breathe moments after the Kennedy shooting, stating: "It's all vague now. I'm sure you all have it in your records. I can't deny it or confirm it. I just wish this whole thing had never taken place."&lt;ref name="WaPo2016" /&gt; Sirhan's parole was denied on the grounds that he had not expressed adequate remorse for his crime or acknowledged its severity.

'''Michele Sindona''' ({{IPA-it|miˈkɛːle sinˈdoːna|lang}}; May 8, 1920 &amp;ndash; March 22, 1986) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[banker]] and convicted [[felony|felon]]. Known in banking circles as "The Shark", Sindona was a member of [[Propaganda Due]] (#0501),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Web of scandal entangles P2 | work= The Times | date = 1981-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a secret lodge of Italian [[Grande Oriente d'Italia|Freemasonry]], and had clear connections to the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. He was fatally poisoned in [[prison]] while serving a life [[sentence (law)|sentence]] for the murder of lawyer [[Giorgio Ambrosoli]].

==Early years==
Born at [[Patti, Sicily|Patti]], a small ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Messina]] ([[Sicily]]), to a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] father, a [[florist]] who specialized in funeral wreaths,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaegiustizia.it/2009/10/09/sindona-funambolo-del-900/ ''Sindona funambolo del 900'']. [[Corrado Stajano]]. Libertà e giustizia. 9 ottobre 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Sicilians|Sicilian]] mother, Sindona was educated by the [[Jesuit]]s, and showed very early in his life an unusual aptitude for [[mathematics]] and [[economics]]. He graduated with a law degree from the [[University of Messina]] in 1942. He then moved from Sicily to [[Northern Italy]] where he worked as a tax lawyer and an accountant for companies such as [[Società Generale Immobiliare]] and [[SNIA S.p.A.|SNIA Viscosa]], but immediately turned away from the law and began working in [[smuggling]] operations with the Mafia.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He soon moved to [[Milan]], and his skill and dexterity in transferring money to avoid [[taxation]] soon became known to Mafia bosses. By 1957, he had become closely associated with the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino family]] and was chosen to manage their profits from [[heroin]] sales.

==International banker==
Within a year of the Gambino family's choosing him to manage their heroin profits, Sindona had bought his first bank. He also became a friend of future Pope [[Giovanni Battista Montini]]'s; Montini was at the time Cardinal of the [[Archdiocese of Milan]]. By the time Montini became Pope Paul VI, Sindona had acquired, through his holding company [[Fasco]], many more Italian banks, and his progress continued right up to the beginning of his association with the [[Vatican Bank]] in 1969. Huge amounts of money moved from Sindona's banks through the Vatican to [[Swiss banks]], and he began speculating against major currencies on a large scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1972, Sindona purchased a controlling interest in [[Long Island]]'s [[Franklin National Bank]] from Lawrence Tisch. He was hailed as "the saviour of the lira" and was named "Man of the Year" in January 1974 by the US ambassador to Italy, [[John Volpe]]. But that April, a sudden stock market crash led to what is known as ''Il Crack Sindona''. The Franklin Bank's profit fell by as much as 98% compared to the previous year, and Sindona suffered a 40 million dollar loss. Consequently, he began losing most of the banks he had acquired over the previous seventeen years. On October 8, 1974, the bank was declared [[insolvent]] due to mismanagement and [[fraud]], involving losses in foreign currency [[speculation]] and poor loan policies. Part of the losses involved Sindona's transfer of $30,000,000 of Bank funds to Europe to recover his losses.&lt;ref name=tim070480&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,921970,00.html |title=Account Settled|work=TIME|date= April 7, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[the Mafia]] ''[[pentito]]'' [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], Sindona laundered the proceeds of heroin trafficking for the [[Stefano Bontade|Bontade]]-Spatola-[[Salvatore Inzerillo|Inzerillo]]-[[Rosario Gambino|Gambino]] network. The mafiosi were determined to get their money back and would play an important role in Sindona's attempt to save his banks.&lt;ref name=rep131002&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/politica/calvi/giuffre/giuffre.html |title=Anche Antonino Giuffré nell'inchiesta Calvi|work= La Repubblica|date=October 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, trial and death==
On July 11, 1979, [[Giorgio Ambrosoli]], the lawyer who was commissioned as [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] of Sindona's banks, was murdered in [[Milan]]. [[Milan]]ese Councilman Antonio Amati turned the case over to a young judge, Giuliano Turone. It was discovered that Michele Sindona ordered Ambrosoli's murder (which was carried out by an American [[assassination|assassin]]). At the same time, the Mafia killed police superintendent [[Boris Giuliano]] in [[Palermo]]. He was investigating the Mafia’s heroin trafficking and had contacted Ambrosoli just two weeks before that to compare investigations.&lt;ref name=sterling190&gt;{{cite book|author=Sterling|title=Octopus|pages= 190–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While under indictment in the US, Sindona pretended to have been [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] in August 1979, to conceal a mysterious 11-week trip to Sicily before his scheduled fraud trial. The brother-in-law of Mafia boss [[Stefano Bontade]], Giacomo Vitale, was one of the persons who organized Sindona’s travel. The real purpose of the "kidnapping" was to issue thinly-disguised blackmail notes to Sindona’s past political allies – among them Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recover the [[Cosa Nostra]]’s money.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

He{{who|date=November 2018}} threatened [[Enrico Cuccia]], president of the [[Mediobanca]], who was opposed to the reorganization/rescue plan.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/728/728.F2d.77.83-2338.83-2336.641.642.html ''Messina and Arico v. United States of America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325093048/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/728/728.F2d.77.83-2338.83-2336.641.642.html |date=2012-03-25 }}, United States Court of Appeals, February 7, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Palermo]], Sindona went to the house of Dr. Joseph Miceli Crimi, an American-Italian [[Physician|doctor]] and Freemason. Crimi later admitted to the judges that he went to [[Arezzo]] to talk with [[Licio Gelli]] about Sindona's situation. Licio Gelli then started to interest two judges, Giuliano Turone and [[Gherardo Colombo]].

The plot failed. After his supposed release from the kidnappers Sindona surrendered to the FBI. He was convicted in 1980 in the United States on 65 counts, including [[fraud]], [[perjury]], false bank statements, and misappropriation of bank funds. He was represented by one of the nation's leading attorneys, [[Ivan Fisher]]. While Sindona was serving time in US Federal Prison, the Italian government applied for his extradition back to Italy to stand trial for murder. "The Shark" was sentenced to 25 years in Italian prison on March 27, 1984. On March 18, 1986, he was poisoned with cyanide in his coffee, in his cell at the prison in [[Voghera]] while serving a life sentence for the murder of Giorgio Ambrosoli.&lt;ref name=nyt230386&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/world/michele-sindona-jailed-italian-financier-dies-cyanide-poisoning-65-center.html |title=Michele Sindona, Jailed Italian Financier, Dies of Cyanide Poisoning at 65|work=The New York Times|date= March 23, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Sarret was born in [[Trieste]], of Greek descent, and emigrated to France in his youth. He studied medicine, chemistry and law at the [[University of Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=Jay Robert|title=Encyclopedia of World Crime: S-Z |date=1990|publisher=CrimeBooks|isbn=9780923582043|page=2680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzQRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=anatole+deibler+1934+Georges-Alexandre+Sarret&amp;dq=anatole+deibler+1934+Georges-Alexandre+Sarret&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjllOmwutHUAhUU5WMKHaOyCMsQ6AEILDAB|accessdate=22 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a lawyer and then a swindler, beginning a life insurance scam, in which two of his lovers, German sisters Catherine and Philomène Schmidt, married unhealthy men. The scheme involved another accomplice, Louis Chambon-Duverger, who would go for a medical examination while posing as one of the unhealthy husbands in order to be approved for life insurance. The husband's death would then be hastened via poison or some other measure, and the life insurance shared among the conspirators. Sarret and the sisters lived together in the suburbs of [[Aix-en-Provence]] at a villa they dubbed ''L'Hermitage''.&lt;ref name="mattei"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattei|first1=Christine|title=Crimes et Criminels... des Histoires a Perdre La Tête|date=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781326190712|pages=121-125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbZ3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121|accessdate=22 June 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at some point Sarret decided that Chambon-Duverger had become too greedy. In 1925, Sarret murdered him along with his mistress, Noémie Ballandraux. He then dumped their corpses in [[sulphuric acid]] to dispose of their bodies. This crime went unsolved for six years until Catherine Schmidt was arrested for another life insurance scheme, in which she faked her own death by obtaining the body of a woman her own age and general description who had died of [[tuberculosis]]. Catherine moved to [[Nice]] to hide out, but fell in love with a man there and followed him to [[Marseille]], very close to Aix-en-Provence, where she was recognized. During police interrogation, she confessed to her crimes as well as to what Sarret had done.&lt;ref name="mattei"/&gt;

Sarret successfully delayed trial for two years, but was found guilty in October 1933 and sentenced to death. He was guillotined a few months later by [[Anatole Deibler]]. The Schmidt sisters each received 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="mattei"/&gt;

==In popular culture==

The Sarret case was told by Solange Fasquelle in the book (''Le Trio infernal)'' ''[[The Infernal Trio]]'' , which was adapted to the cinema in 1974 under the same title by [[Francis Girod]], starring [[Michel Piccoli]] as Sarret, [[Romy Schneider]] as Philomène Schmidt and [[Mascha Gonska]] as Catherine Schmidt.&lt;ref name="mattei"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Issei Sagawa'''|佐川 一政|Sagawa Issei|extra=born April 26, 1949}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learning-history.com/issei-sagawa/|title=Issei Sagawa: Cannibal Killer|website=Learning History|accessdate=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Pang''', is a Japanese man who, while living in [[Paris]] in 1981, killed and [[cannibal]]ized a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] woman. He was released after two years of pre-trial detention upon being found [[legally insane]].

==Early life==
Sagawa was born in [[Kobe]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan, to wealthy parents. He was born prematurely, reportedly small enough to fit in the palm of his father's hand, and immediately developed [[enteritis]], a disease of the small intestine. He eventually recovered after several injections of potassium and calcium in saline.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

Sagawa first experienced cannibalistic desires while in the first grade, after seeing a male's thigh.&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt; In a 2011 interview with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', Sagawa reported that as a youth he partook in [[bestiality]] with his dog and experienced cannibalistic desires for women.&lt;ref name="vicevid"/&gt;

At 24, in [[Tokyo]], Sagawa followed a tall German woman home, then broke into her apartment while she was sleeping with intent to cannibalize her by slicing off part of her buttocks and sneaking away with a small part of her flesh. She awoke and, Sagawa claims, pushed him to the ground. He was captured by police and charged with attempted rape. He did not confess his true intentions to authorities.&lt;ref name="vicevid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BosZxa1bYcE|title=Interview with a Cannibal|work=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, at the age of 27, Sagawa moved to France to pursue a Ph.D. in literature at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; He has said that while residing in Paris, "Almost every night I would bring a prostitute home and then try to shoot them, but for some reason my fingers froze up and I couldn't pull the trigger."&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/whos-hungry-502-v16n1|title=Who's Hungry?|last=Kosuga|first=Tomokazu|author2=Lena Oishi, Lena|date=January 1, 2009 |work=Vice Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing of Hartevelt==
On June 11, 1981, Sagawa, then 32, invited his Sorbonne classmate Renée Hartevelt to dinner at his apartment at 10 Rue Erlanger, under the pretext of translating poetry for a school assignment.

Those suitcases contained the dismembered body parts of Renée Hartevelt.

Sagawa's wealthy father provided a lawyer for his defense, and after being held for two years awaiting trial Sagawa was found [[Insanity defence |legally insane]] and unfit to stand trial by the French judge, [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], who ordered him held indefinitely in a mental institution.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; After a visit by the author [[Inuhiko Yomota]], Sagawa's account of his kill was published in Japan under the title ''In the Fog''.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Sagawa's subsequent publicity and macabre celebrity likely contributed to the French authorities' decision to deport him to Japan, where he was immediately committed to Matsuzawa hospital. Examining psychologists there all declared him sane and found sexual perversion was his sole motivation for murder.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Because charges in France had been dropped, the French court documents were sealed and were not released to Japanese authorities; consequently Sagawa could not legally be detained in Japan. He checked himself out of the hospital on August 12, 1986, and remains free.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; Sagawa's continued freedom has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

'''Susan Leigh Smith''' (née '''Vaughan'''; born September 26, 1971) is an American convict who was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]] with the possibility of [[parole]] after serving 30 years for murdering her two children, three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Werner U.|last=Spitz|title=Spitz and Fisher's Medicolegal Investigation of Death.

Thomas Publishing Ltd.|location=Springfield, Illinois|ISBN=978-0398075446|pages=846–881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case gained international attention because of Smith's false claim that a [[Black-American]] man had kidnapped her sons during a [[carjacking]]. Her defense attorneys, [[David Bruck]] and [[Judy Clarke]], called [[expert witness]]es to testify that she suffered from mental health issues that impaired her judgment when she committed the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Smith, Mother Who Killed Kids:|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/susan-smith-mother-who-killed-kids-something-went-very-wrong-n397051|website=NBC News|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[South Carolina Department of Corrections]], Smith will be eligible for parole on November 4, 2024, after serving a minimum of 30 years. She is incarcerated at the [[Leath Correctional Institution]] near Greenwood, South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.is/20121224134012/https://sword.doc.state.sc.us/incarceratedInmateSearch/incarceratedInmateFaceSheet.do?id=00221487&amp;youth=N&amp;type=F Inmate Details Susan Smith]."

==Family background==
Susan Smith rarely had a stable home life growing up. Her father committed suicide when she was six years old, and Smith herself attempted suicide at age 13. Her mother then married Beverly Russell, a member of the local chapter of the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], who later was revealed to have [[Child molestation|molested]] Smith when she was a teenager. One newspaper claimed that sexual relations between them had continued until six months before the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Elizabeth|last=Gleick|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,134423,00.html|title=Sex, betrayal, and murder|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=June 24, 2001|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school in 1989, Smith made a second attempt to kill herself after a married man ended the affair they had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rachel |last=Pergament |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/smith/phase_10.html|title=Susan Smith Child Murderer or Victim? |website=Crime Library |publisher= [[TruTV]] |access-date=February 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229153514/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/smith/phase_10.html |archive-date=December 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She married David Smith, and they had two sons. The relationship was rocky due to mutual allegations of infidelity, and they separated several times.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/susan-smith-mother-who-killed-kids-something-went-very-wrong-n397051|title=Susan Smith, Mother Who Killed Kids: ‘Something Went Very Wrong That Night’|website=[[NBC News]]|date=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
On October 25, 1994, Smith reported to police that her vehicle had been carjacked by a black man who drove away with her sons still inside. The composite sketch of the alleged carjacker, however was "too generic" in the sense that it described half of the African-American men who lived in the community. For nine days, she made dramatic pleas on national television for their rescue and return. However, following an intensive investigation and a nationwide search, she confessed on November 3, 1994 to letting her car roll into nearby [[John D. Long Lake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John D. Long Lake|url=http://scgreatoutdoors.com/park-johndlonglake.html|website=scgreatoutdoors.com|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; drowning them inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles|last=Montaldo| website=About.com | publisher= The New York Times Company|url=http://crime.about.com/od/murder/a/susan_smith.htm|title=Susan Smith — Profile of a Child Killer | date=April 1, 2018|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her motivation was reportedly to facilitate a relationship with a local wealthy man by the name of Tom Findlay. Prior to the murders he sent Susan a letter ending their relationship and expressing that he does not want kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Kathy | last = Kemp |url = http://www.alabamapress.org/uploads/Cat%2012%20Div%20A_Feature.pdf | title = In The Arms of Angels | newspaper = [[Birmingham News]] | publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location = Birmingham, Alabama | date = April 17, 2005 | accessdate = &lt;!-----7 April 2010-----&gt; | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724232211/http://www.alabamapress.org/uploads/Cat%2012%20Div%20A_Feature.pdf | archivedate = July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that there was no motive nor did she plan the murders, stating that she was not in a right state of mind.&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;

Later investigation revealed that detectives doubted Smith's story from the start and believed that she murdered her sons. By the second day of the investigation, the police suspected that she knew their location and hoped that they were still alive. Investigators started to search the nearby lakes and ponds, including John D. Long Lake, where their bodies eventually were found. Initial water searches did not locate the car because the police believed it would be within 30 feet of the shore, and did not search farther; it turned out to be 122 feet from the shore. After the boys had been missing for two days, Smith and her estranged husband David were subjected to a [[polygraph]] test. The biggest breakthrough of the case was her description of the carjacking location. She had claimed that a traffic light had turned red causing her to stop at an otherwise empty intersection. However, it was determined that the light would not have turned red for her unless a vehicle was present on the intersecting road. This conflicted with her statement that she did not see any other cars there when the carjacking took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Harrison|last1=Cahill|title=Susan Smith: 20 years later, case still a shocker|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article13900058.html|newspaper=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|location=Columbia, South Carolina|date=October 18, 2014|accessdate=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's defense psychiatrist diagnosed her with [[dependent personality disorder]] and [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rachel|last=Pergament|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/smith/trial_9.html|title=Child murderer or victim?|website=[[Crime Library]]|publisher=[[TruTV]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018034549/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/famous/smith/trial_9.html|archive-date=October 18, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarceration==
Smith was incarcerated in the Administrative Segregation Unit in the [[Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution]] in Columbia, South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Bill|last=Hewitt|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105269,00.html|title=Tears of Hate &amp; Pity|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|volume=43|number=10|date=March 13, 1995|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Smith's incarceration at the Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution, two correctional officers, Lieutenant Houston Cagle and Captain Alfred R. Rowe Jr., were charged after having sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sex with Child Killer Charged Again |publisher =[[ABC News]]| url =http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95630&amp;page=1 | date=September 26, 2017|accessdate =September 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, she was moved to the [[Leath Correctional Institution]] in Greenwood.{{fact|date=January 2020}}

'''Ruth Brown Snyder''' (March 27, 1895 – January 12, 1928) was an [[United States|American]] [[murder]]er. Her [[death penalty|execution]] in the [[electric chair]] at [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Sing Sing Prison]] in 1928 for the murder of her husband, Albert Snyder, was recorded in a well-publicized photograph.

==Crime==
Ruth Brown Snyder was a housewife from [[Queens]], a borough of [[New York City]], who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married [[corset]] salesman, in 1925. She began to plan the murder of her husband Albert, enlisting Gray's help, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Ruth's distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late fiancée Jessie Guischard on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as "the finest woman I have ever met," had been dead for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:93NhH52erasJ:http://www.trivia-library.com/a/the-snyder-gray-murder-case-part-2.htm+Ruth+Brown+Snyder+was+born&amp;hl=en&amp;strip=1|title=Snyder/Gray case details|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth first persuaded Albert to purchase [[insurance]], and, with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for [[forgery]]) "signed" a $48,000 life insurance policy that [[double indemnity|paid extra]] if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill Albert, all of which he survived.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1928/01/13/page/2/article/ruths-brother-and-mother-object-to-prison-post-mortem|title=Story of the Crime|date=January 13, 1928|publisher=Chicago Tribune|page=2|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1927, the couple [[garrotte]]d Albert and stuffed his nose full of [[chloroform]]-soaked rags, then staged his death as part of a [[burglary]].&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, Ruth's behavior was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife's witnessing her husband being killed.&lt;ref name=murder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1935/12/29/page/65/article/snyder-murder-husband-victim-of-wife-and-her-weakling-paramour|title=Snyder Murder|author=Murchie, Guy, Jr.|date=December 29, 1935|pages=9–10|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police discovered that the property Ruth had claimed had been stolen was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters "J.G." on it (it was a memento Albert had kept from former lover Guischard), and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to Gray, whose initials were also "J.G.," and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with the murder. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police instantly became suspicious. Gray was found upstate in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. He claimed he had been there all night, but it was eventually found out a friend of his had set up Gray's room at a hotel to support his [[alibi]]. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught and returned to Queens and charged along with Ruth.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; [[Dorothy Parker]] told [[Oscar Levant]] that Gray tried to escape the police by taking a taxi from [[Long Island]] to [[Manhattan]], which Levant noted was "quite a long trip." According to Parker, in order "not to attract attention, he gave the driver a ten-cent tip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levant|first=Oscar|title=The Memoirs of an Amnesiac|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofamnesia00leva|url-access=registration|publisher=G.

Ruth and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert; both were convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1927/05/05/page/1/article/women-faint-at-grays-horror-story|title=Women Faint at Gray's Horror Story|date=May 5, 1927|pages=2, 4|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
Ruth was imprisoned at [[Sing Sing]] in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]], located thirty miles north of New York City. On January 12, 1928, she became the first woman to be executed at Sing Sing since [[Martha Place]] in 1899. She went to the [[electric chair]] only moments ahead of Gray, her former lover.&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Her execution (by [[New York State Electrician]] [[Robert G. Elliott]]) was caught on film, at the moment electricity was running through her body, with the aid of a miniature [[plate camera]] strapped to the ankle of [[Tom Howard (photographer)|Tom Howard]], a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' photographer working in cooperation with the ''Tribune''-owned ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="siedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=472|title=HistoryWired: A Few of Our Favorite Things|website=National Museum of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's camera was later owned by inventor [[Miller Reese Hutchison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of camera that took death cell pictures a recent visitor here|url=http://bplonline.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4017coll2&amp;CISOPTR=171&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=4|work=Clipping from [[The Birmingham News]]|publisher=[[Birmingham Public Library]]|date=February 9, 1938|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became part of the collections of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref name="siedu"/&gt;

Ruth was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]]. Her footstone simply reads "May R." with her date of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lorraine Snyder==
Albert and Ruth had one child, a daughter named Lorraine, who was nine at the time of her father's murder. Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on her mother in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives of both parents regarding the care of the child. Warren Schneider, &lt;!-- no explanation of why variation of brothers' surname spelling --&gt;brother of Albert, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a [[legal guardian]] who was not a member of Ruth's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth, also petitioned for custody of the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To Seek Guardian for Lorraine Snyder|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kq0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fGkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=4608,3431254|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=May 12, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine had been in the care of Mrs. Brown since the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Snyder's Family|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=supPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3lQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown&amp;pg=2323,5380779|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Evening Independent|date=January 10, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Rush Snyder Insurance Case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HcsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2713,738843|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 13, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruth Snyder Brown Grave 1024.jpg|thumb|The grave of Ruth Brown Snyder in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]On September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Give Snyder Tot to Grandparent|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WzkbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LUoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=custody+lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=1006,2571474|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=September 7, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth [[US$]]30,000, was paid without contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dual Execution Makes Trio Ill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HssaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4ksEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown&amp;pg=1978,1172947|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=January 14, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth ${{Inflation|US|0.08|1927|r=2|fmt=c}} million today). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected because they had been issued [[fraud]]ulently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appeal Ruling Against Child|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=328bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorraine+snyder&amp;pg=6348,352384|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=November 11, 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Ruth's family asked the court to allow them to [[appeal]] without a printed record on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930, it was ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snyder Insurance Policies Not Valid|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SB0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lWYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=josephine+brown+snyder&amp;pg=4876,7417631|accessdate=4 July 2017|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|date=June 21, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adriano Sofri 2014.JPG|thumb|Adriano Sofri]]
'''Adriano Sofri''' (born 1 August 1942) is an Italian [[intellectual]], a [[journalist]] and a writer. The former leader of the [[autonomist]] movement ''[[Lotta Continua]]'' ("Continuous Struggle") in the 1960s, he was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to 22 years of prison, having been found guilty of instigating the murder of police officer [[Luigi Calabresi]]. Sofri, and the others comrades convicted with him, have always proclaimed their innocence. The charges against them rested on the testimony of a ''[[pentito]]'' ("collaborator of justice"), Leonardo Marino. While in prison, Sofri wrote for various newspapers, such as ''[[Il Foglio]]'', ''[[La Repubblica]]'', and ''[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]''.

==Life==
Adriano Sofri was born 1 August 1942 in [[Trieste]].

==Calabresi murder==
On 12 December 1969 a bomb exploded at the [[Piazza Fontana bombing|Piazza Fontana]] in Milan. Among those brought in for questioning was militant anarchist [[Giuseppe Pinelli]]. On 15 December 1969, while in police custody Pinelli fell from a fourth floor window of the police building in [[Milan]]. The policemen present in the interrogation room claimed that Pinelli committed suicide, but many leftist circles believed him to have been murdered. An initial investigation in 1970 ruled Pinelli's death an accident. (A subsequent inquiry in 1975 concurred, holding that Pinelli had fainted due to an "active illness").

Despite the fact that it was established that Calabresi had not been in the room at the time of Pinelli's death,&lt;ref name=dell&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php%3FthreadId%3DSOFRI%2BAdriano&amp;prev=search Dell'Arti, Giorgio. "Adriano Sofri", ''Corriere Della Sera'', 19 September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; he became the target of an extensive media campaign led by the ''[[Lotta Continua]]'' newspaper and the weekly ''L'Espresso'' because of his alleged involvement in Pinelli's death. On 15 December 1969, the Lotta Continua newspaper directed by Sofri explicitly claimed that Calabresi had to be "shot dead". The press campaign against Calabresi continued for the next two years.

On the morning of 17 May 1972 Calabresi was shot and killed outside his home. Members of ''Lotta Continua'' were considered to be the prime suspects.

==Arrest==
In July 1988, Leonardo Marino, an ex-activist, confessed to taking part in the assassination of Calabresi. Marino claimed that he was driving the car, while Ovidio Bompressi allegedly shot Calabresi. He said that the assassination had been decided by Adriano Sofri and Giorgio Pietrostefani, the leaders of ''[[Lotta Continua]]''. Based on testimony provided by Marino, on 28 July 1988, Sofri was arrested with Ovidio Bompressi and Giorgio Pietrostefani for the murder of police officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] on 17 May 1972.&lt;ref name=dell/&gt;

==Trial ==
In the long series of trials, that spanned about two decades and that alternated acquittals with sentences of guilt, the evidence against Sofri was only the [[Confession (law)|confession]] of ''[[pentito]]'' ("collaborator of justice") Leonardo Marino, who accused Sofri of having ordered him, as chief of ''Lotta Continua'', to assassinate Calabresi, during a meeting held on a piazza after a demonstration in [[Pisa]] on 13 May 1972, in the name of Franco Serantini, an anarchist who died from lack of care in the police station following a demonstration in the same city on May 5.

Sofri denied having talked with Marino at this alleged meeting, pointing out that on this day, it was pouring with rain, and that the town was under surveillance by the police. This was confirmed by other participants of the demonstration.

Sofri was convicted on 2 May 1990 and [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to serve 22 years in the prison of [[Pisa]] . Pietrostefani and Bompressi also received 22 years, while Marino was sentenced to 11 years.

==Appeal==
By the time the appeals process began various pieces of evidence were no longer available. The clothes which Calabresi was wearing on the day of his death were never found. The blue [[Fiat 125]] (which Marino declared beige) was sent to the breaker's yard on 31 December 1988. The bullet which killed Calabresi was auctioned on 15 April 1990, after a flood which had damaged the office holding the material evidence of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Ginzburg]], ''The Judge and the Historian: Marginal Notes on a Late Twentieth-Century Miscarriage of Justice'', Chapter XIV ({{ISBN|1-85984-371-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1991, the Court of Appeals upheld the convictions,&lt;ref name=dell/&gt; but this was reversed the following year by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]]. Sofri and others were acquitted in 1993. However, after the Cassation's cancellation of the previous judgment, a new trial took place, and they were convicted, again, to 22 years of prison, in 1995 &amp;mdash; (Sofri, Marino and others were also accused of armed robberies). The Court of Cassation confirmed this last judgment in 1997. Pietrostefani, was residing in France with and no chances of being [[extradition|extradited]].

Marino initially claimed that the weight of his conscience had pushed him to confess his crimes, which he allegedly had done on 19 July 1988 to the [[carabinieri]] in [[Ameglia]], a little town, before going to [[Milan]] where he allegedly described with precision the assassination of Calabresi &amp;mdash; remaining before to general facts &amp;mdash; to Ferdinando Pomarici, substitute of the attorney, and [[investigative magistrate]] Antonio Lombardi. However, on 20 February 1990, two years after the beginning of the trial, a witness of the Court, carabinieri officer Emilio Rossi, declared that Marino had first presented himself to the carabinieris in Ameglia on 2 July 1988. Although historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] has interrogated himself on the possibility that Marino's contact with the carabinieri were to be traced to May, in any cases, the judicial documents did not register this period during which Marino was in contact with the Italian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, chap. VII&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of other discrepancies in Marino's testimony against Sofri have led many to suspect the reliability of his words, on which Sofri's sentence exclusively relies. These include his first account, where he claimed that Bompressi and Sofri ordered him the assassination, whether that later became only Sofri; his description of the itinerary that he allegedly followed immediately after the crime, during which he said he had gone in the exact opposite direction of where the Fiat had been finally abandoned; confusion about when his qualms of conscience came to arise, as soon as 1972 or in "the last three years"; the fact that he had been convicted for [[armed robbery]] on 1987, thus making his claims about his moral concerns dubious &lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, chap. XV&lt;/ref&gt;...

Furthermore, the description of the crime scene by eyewitnesses contradicted those of Leonardo Marino. But the [[Cour d'assise]] of Milan, headed by the president Manlio Minale, finally decided that Marino's testimony was completely reliable, which was allegedly not the case of those various eyewitnesses invoked during the trial.

On the other hand, it has to be noticed that Marino's confession was given so much time after the facts that some contradictions are somewhat unavoidable.

In favor of Sofri, there was a large opinion movement, including politicians, intellectuals and artists, including [[Dario Fo]], [[Giuliano Ferrara]], [[Gad Lerner]], [[Luigi Ciotti]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615044447/http://www.sofri.org/ Il caso Sofri, Bompressi, Pietrostefani]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Veltroni]], [[Piero Fassino]], judge [[Ferdinando Imposimato]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/2000/01/25/Cronaca/SOFRI-IMPOSIMATO-SDI-VIOLATI-PRINCIPI-GIUSTO-PROCESSO_164700.php ''Sofri, Imposimato (SDI): Violati i principi del giusto processo'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinando Imposimato, ''L'errore giudiziario: aspetti giuridici e casi pratici'', Giuffré, 2008, pag. 106-108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Pannella]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2003/08_Agosto/13/pannella.shtml ''La grazia a Sofri: il digiuno di Pannella'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasco Rossi]], [[Adriano Celentano]], [[Jovanotti]], [[Gianna Nannini]], [[Paolo Hendel]], [[Emmanuelle Béart]], [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/ora-sofri-solo.html Luca Telese, ''Ora Sofri è solo'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vittorio Sgarbi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolliblog.net/2003/12/23/vittorio-sgarbi-saddam-nel-tombino-e-sofri/ Vittorio Sgarbi, ''Saddam nel tombino e Sofri'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesco Tullio Altan]], [[Niccolò Ammaniti]], [[Stefano Benni]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Andrea Zanzotto]], [[Franco Battiato]], [[Lucio Dalla]], [[Fabrizio De André]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Fabio Fazio]], [[Gillo Pontecorvo]], [[Gabriele Salvatores]] and [[Massimo Cacciari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1997/05/22/centomila-firme-per-sofri-giustizia-spietata.html ''Centomila firme per Sofri "Giustizia spietata"'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment ==

The convictions were upheld in 2000. Sofri has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so to this day. He has become a columnist writing for ''[[Il Foglio]]'' and ''[[La Repubblica]]''. He also writes editorials in ''[[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]]''.

At the end of November, 2005, Adriano Sofri suffered [[Boerhaave syndrome]] while in prison. He was moved to a hospital and was considered for a pardon, but Justice Minister [[Roberto Castelli]] refused in December 2005 to grant one. However, after the defeat of the [[Silvio Berlusconi]] government during the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 election]], the new [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]], [[Clemente Mastella]], announced that Sofri could be pardoned before the end of the calendar year, although he continued to refuse to ask for a pardon, saying such a request would be admission of guilt. The Justice Minister nonetheless argued that "The truth is that 34 years after the events Sofri is a very sick person to whom one can offer a spontaneously humane gesture."&lt;ref&gt;"Sofri: Mastella, Pardon Within the Year", 30 May 2006, ''[[Agenzia Giornalistica Italia]]'' {{in lang|en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not receive a pardon, but from 2007 he was allowed to serve his sentence under [[house arrest]] for medical reasons. The 22-year sentence ended in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2012/01/16/visualizza_new.html_45127061.html | title = Ex-militant and writer Sofri ends jail term | date = 16 January 2012 | work = [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA English]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlo Ginzburg]], who usually studies [[witch-hunt]]s during the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] and [[microhistory]], has written a book concerning this alleged "[[miscarriage of justice]]" and the relations, and differences, between the works of a judge and of a historian.

'''Eugen Waldemar Schauman''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Владимирович Шауман}}, ''Evgeny Vladimirovich Shauman''; {{OldStyleDate|May 10|1875|22}} – {{OldStyleDate|16 June|1904|4}}) was a [[Swedish language|Swedish speaking]] [[Finland|Finnish]] nationalist and nobleman who assassinated the [[Governor-General of Finland|Governor-General]] [[Nikolai Ivanovich Bobrikov]].

== Schauman's life ==
Eugen Schauman was born to [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] [[Finland|Finnish]] parents Waldemar, a general-lieutenant in the Imperial Russian army, a Privy Councillor and senator in the Finnish Government, and Elin Maria Schauman in Kharkov, [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]). His brother Rafael was born in 1873 and his sister [[Sigrid Schauman|Sigrid]] in 1877.

Schauman's [[patriotism]] is rumoured to have been awakened in his childhood when his mother used to read him ''[[The Tales of Ensign Stål]]'' by [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]]. The tales were combined with his yearning for home since the family was forced to travel because of his father's work.

Before the assassination Schauman worked as a clerk in the [[Senate of Finland]]. Schauman also arranged a series of marksmanship courses for local students in [[Helsinki]]. These courses later became a part of the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]].

== Assassination ==
[[File:Schauman shoots Bobrikov.jpg|thumb|A drawing of the assassination by an unknown author.]]

The assassination of Bobrikov was a topical question among the Finnish activists of the time. Other activist groups are known to have planned an assassination but Schauman convinced them to give him two weeks before they would intervene.

When Bobrikov came to the Senate house on 16 June, Schauman shot him three times, and then himself twice in the chest, using a [[FN M1900|FN Browning M1900 pistol]], with specially handloaded explosive bullets{{what|date=April 2020}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guns.connect.fi/gow/arcane2.html ''Gunwriters' Handloading Subsonic Cartridges, Part 2''], P.T. Kekkonen, 1999. Accessed on 12 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Schauman died instantly. Two of the bullets that hit Bobrikov ricocheted off his decoration, but the third bounced back from his buckle and caused severe damage to his stomach. Bobrikov died the same night in the Helsinki surgical hospital.

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Eugen SchaumaninhautaPorvoonhautausmaalla.JPG|thumb|250px|The grave of Eugen Schauman in the Porvoo cemetery]]

Schauman left a letter in which he stated that he justified his actions as a punishment for Bobrikov's crimes against the people of Finland. He addressed the letter to the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and wanted him to pay attention to the problems in the whole of the Russian empire, especially in [[Congress Poland|Poland]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] region. He also claimed he had acted alone and emphasized that his family was not involved in the assassination.

Schauman's body was taken to an unmarked grave in the [[Malmi cemetery]] in Helsinki. After the political situation eased up he was reburied in the Schauman family grave in the [[Porvoo]] cemetery and a monument was built on the grave.

== Schauman's legacy ==
Schauman became something of an icon for the resistance to Imperial Russia and many Finns still consider him a hero. His fame can be characterized by his ranking as the 34th greatest Finn of all time in the [[Suuret suomalaiset]] (Greatest Finns) television poll. In the place of the assassination in the hallway of the [[Government Palace (Finland)|Council of State]] there is a memorial plaque that states ''Se Pro Patria Dedit'' (he gave himself for his country).

[[Jean Sibelius]] composed the funeral march ''[[In Memoriam (Sibelius)|In Memoriam]]'' in memory of him.&lt;ref name="Sibelius"&gt;{{cite web

'''Maria Alexandrovna Spiridonova''' ({{lang-ru|Мари́я Алекса́ндровна Спиридо́нова}}; 16 October 1884 – 11 September 1941) was a [[Narodnik]]-inspired [[Russia]]n [[revolution]]ary. In 1906, as a novice member of a local combat group of the [[Tambov]]  [[Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries|Socialists-Revolutionaries (SRs)]],&lt;ref&gt;Immediately after the Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries was founded in 1901, its Central Committee established a separate central terrorist unit, usually called the '[[SR Combat Organization|Combat Organisation]]' (''Boyevaya Organizatsiya''), specializing in the assassination of state leaders and officials of the highest rank. Besides it, "the SR leadership relied on smaller terrorist or combat units (''boevye druzhiny''), on the flying combat detachments (''letuchie boevye otriady''), or on isolated individuals to carry out assassinations". In the provinces party committees operated local combat units or resorted to individuals, in order to execute the death sentences they passed on provincial tsarist officials (Geifman, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; she assassinated a security official. Her subsequent abuse by police earned her enormous popularity with the opponents of [[Tsarism]] throughout the empire and even abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Boniece, ''The &lt;u&gt;Shesterka&lt;/u&gt;'', and McDermid, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending over 11 years in Siberian prisons she was freed after the [[February Revolution of 1917]], and returned to [[European Russia]] as a heroine of the destitute, and especially of the peasants. She was the only woman other than [[Alexandra Kollontai]] to play a truly important role during the [[Russian Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cole, IV, part II, p. 842.&lt;/ref&gt; leading the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]] to initially side with [[Lenin]] and the [[Bolsheviks]], and then to break with them.

From 1918 on, she was repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, briefly detained in a mental sanitarium, sent into internal exile, and finally shot in 1941. A successful campaign was run to discredit her name and portray her as a hysterical extremist, and she was "forced into oblivion".&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 424. The Soviet attitude over time towards Spiridonova is exemplified by the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'': no mention of her was made in either of the first two editions, published respectively during 1926–1947 and 1950–1958, and not until 1976 did a brief sketch appear in the third edition, vol. 24 (Maxwell, ''Narodniki women'', p. 176).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, when publishing the fourth volume of ''A History of Socialist Thought'', [[G.D.H. Cole]] wrote that nothing was known of what had happened to her after 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, IV, part I, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later, [[Richard Stites]] was still uncertain whether her death occurred in 1937 or 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''The women's liberation movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism and Bolshevism 1860-1930'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1978; new edition, 1990, p. 313, note 12. {{ISBN|0-691-05254-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the end of [[Stalinism]] and the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] did it gradually become possible to reconstruct the last decades of her life.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Spiridonova was born in the city of [[Tambov]], located approximately {{convert|480|km|mi}} of [[Moscow]]. Her father, a bank official, was a member of the non-hereditary minor [[nobility]] of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Rab182&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the local [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] until 1902, when the death of her father, and a case of [[tuberculosis]], caused her to drop out. She studied [[dentistry]] in Moscow for a short while, before returning to Tambov to work as a clerk for the local [[Assembly of the Nobility]]. She soon became involved in political activism and was arrested during the student demonstrations of March 1905. In September 1905 she applied for training as a [[feldsher]] (a health care professional similar to a [[physician assistant]]) but was rejected due to her political record. Instead, she joined the [[Party of Socialists–Revolutionaries|Party of Socialists–Revolutionaries (SRs)]], and became a full-time activist. During this time, she formed a relationship with [[Vladimir Vol'skii]], a local SR leader.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt;

Like most SRs, she shared the [[Narodniks]]' philosophy of assassination and terrorism as a weapon of revolution, and was one of hundreds of SRs who, in the years around the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]], attacked the Russian state and its leaders.

===Luzhenovsky assassination===
[[File:GershuniYSpiridónovaEnAkatuy1906.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;Spiridonova and [[Grigory Gershuni|Grigory Andreyevich Gershuni]], founder of the [[SR Combat Organization]]&lt;br&gt;(Akatuy 1906)&lt;/div&gt;]]
Spiridonova's target was {{Interlanguage link multi|Gavriil Nikolayevich Luzhenovsky|ru|3=Луженовский, Гавриил Николаевич}}, a landowner and [[Tambov]] [[Zemstvo|provincial councillor]] who had been appointed district security chief in [[Borisoglebsk]], a town southeast of Tambov. Luzhenovsky, also a local leader of the [[Union of the Russian People]] (the most important branch of the [[Black Hundred]]), was known for his harsh suppression of peasant unrest in the district, and the SR committee in Tambov had "passed a death sentence on him". Spiridonova volunteered to kill him. She stalked Luzhenovsky for several days, and finally got her chance at the Borisoglebsk railway station on 16 January 1906. Disguised as a secondary school student, she fired several shots from a revolver and hit Luzhenovsky five times. He died on 10 February 1906.&lt;ref name="boniece"&gt;Boniece, "The Spiridonova Case", pp. 127-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to escape, Spiridonova tried to turn her weapon against herself but was restrained, brutally beaten and arrested by Luzhenovsky's [[Cossack]] guard. She was then transferred to the local police station where she was stripped naked, searched and mocked by her captors. She was interrogated and tortured for more than half a day by two government officials, P.F. Avramov, head of the Cossack guard, and T.S. Zhdanov, a local police officer. That night she was transported to Tambov by train. During the journey, Avramov subjected her to further ill-treatment and sexual harassment, possibly rape.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt;

The Luzhenovsky assassination was one of close to two hundred acts of SR "individual terror" during the [[Revolution of 1905|Revolution of 1905-7]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Anna Geifman, 3611 government officials were attacked by terrorists between October 1905 and September 1906. By the end of 1907, taking into account private individuals too, the number of terrorist casualties exceeded 9000 (''Thou shalt kill'', p. 21).&lt;/ref&gt; It received mainly local attention until the following month,&lt;ref&gt;Boniece, "The Spiridonova Case", pp. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; when Spiridonova succeeded in leaking a very well-thought-out letter to the press. It described the treatment she had received, including threats of gang rape directed at her, and hinted that Avramov might have raped her on the train to Tambov. The letter was published on 12 February 1906  by ''Rus'', a liberal newspaper in [[Saint Petersburg]], and soon taken up by others, becoming an immediate sensation with their readers.

Progressive public opinion in Russia traditionally tended to consider terrorism with a certain degree of understanding, as it was regarded as a natural reaction against autocracy. For example in 1878 a jury caused a sensation by acquitting [[Narodniks|populist]] terrorist [[Vera Zasulich]] despite her pleading guilty to causing serious injury to Colonel [[Fyodor Trepov (senior)|Fyodor Trepov]] during a failed attempt to assassinate him. In the case of Spiridonova, many were outraged by the appalling cruelty to a prisoner, especially as she was an attractive young woman. Liberal circles throughout Russia condemned the Tambov authorities.&lt;ref name="boniece" /&gt; Spiridonova was described as "a pure, virginal being, a flower of spiritual beauty ... [being put] into the shaggy paws of brutally repulsive, brutally malicious, brutally salacious [[orangutan]]s".&lt;ref&gt;"[[Nasha Zhizn]]'" (Our Life), 8 March 1906; quoted in Boniece (2010), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MariaSpiridonovaYCompañerasCaminoDeSiberiaOmsk19060630.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;The ''Shesterka'' ("Six")  photographed at the [[Omsk]] station&lt;br&gt;during their triumphal transfer to Siberia&lt;br&gt;(Spiridonova is the first on the left in the foreground)&lt;/div&gt;]]
''Rus'' sent reporter Vsevolod A. Vladimirov to Tambov. He produced seven sensational articles that appeared in March 1906. These articles exaggerated Spiridonova's mistreatment and injuries, and more explicitly touched on her alleged rape. Vladimirov also glossed over Spiridonova's political convictions, portraying her as a genteel, high-principled victim of the tyrannical Russian system. This annoyed the Tambov SRs almost as much as it did the conservatives and the authorities. Spiridonova herself repudiated Vladimirov's account.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt;

On 11 March, Spiridonova was tried and convicted of Luzhenovsky's murder and sentenced to death. However, the tribunal also asked that the sentence be commuted to penal servitude in [[Siberia]], in view of her ill health. This was approved on 20 March.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt; The liberal press continued its campaign in her support. On 2 April Avramov was himself assassinated, creating a further sensation.&lt;ref&gt;Boniece, "The Spiridonova Case", p. 146. According to Anna Geifman, the second torturer Zhdanov, too, suffered the same fate the following month (p. 341, note no 78).&lt;/ref&gt;

The government released its report on the case on 8 April. The report acknowledged that Spiridonova had been beaten by the Cossacks at the time of her arrest, and that Avramov had verbally abused her on the train, but denied all the more lurid accusations. This was denounced by some as a whitewash.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt;

Secret letters from Spiridonova in prison to her sister Yulia, a fellow SR, had been seized by police on 19 February and were summarized by the Tambov deputy prosecutor in a report to the national authorities. His extracts indicate that Spiridonova consciously participated in the image-making that was going on outside, suggesting what should be emphasized and what should be played down.&lt;ref name="boniece" /&gt; A request in one letter not to reveal her "romantic history", presumably her relationship with Volsky, was quoted. Many liberals called this an attempt to slander her morals. The governor of Tambov had known about the affair (Spiridonova appealed for a meeting with Volsky, whom she described as her fiancé although he was already married), but did not pass on the information, which would have demolished Spiridonova's "virginal" image.&lt;ref name="boniece"/&gt;

Spiridonova was sent to Siberia in the company of five other prominent female SR terrorists. The group was sometimes called the ''Shesterka'' ("Six"). As a result of the press campaign, Spiridonova was the most famous.  She was also young, attractive, and an ethnic Russian (at least four of the others were [[Jew]]ish, [[Belarus]]ian, and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]). The ''Shesterka'' were transported by train from Moscow to the [[Nerchinsk katorga]], a system of [[penal labour|penal labor]] colonies in [[Transbaikal]] (east of [[Lake Baikal]] and near the border of [[China]]). Their slow journey lasted around a month and turned into a kind of triumphal progress:&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Spiridonova'',chapter V: ''Triumphal progress''; p. 45 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the train was met at every stop by growing crowds of sympathizers. Each time, although she was suffering from a serious recurrence of tuberculosis, Spiridonova would get up from her couch, greet the audience with smiles and patiently answer their numerous questions, expounding the SR political program. &lt;ref name="boniece" /&gt; {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexandra Adolfovna Izmailovich|ru|3=Измайлович, Александра Адольфовна}}, one of the ''Shesterka'', later commented:

{{Quote|text=The crowds did not know the rest of us, but who did not know her name? [...] It had become a banner uniting all who seethed with holy indignation—SRs, [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|SDs]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], ordinary people unaffiliated with parties. She belonged not only to the SR Party.

Budnitskij (ed), ''Zhenshchiny-terroristki v Rossii'', Rostov: Feniks, 1996, pp. 400-416, {{ISBN|978-5858801870}}. Here quoted from Boniece, "The Spiridonova Case", p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spiridonova and her comrades were first detained in the [[Akatuy katorga|Akatuy penal colony]]. The prison regime of the colony was exceedingly mild, more similar to a sort of internal exile or political confinement than to a real prison. In 1907, however, they were removed to the new female colony that had been established at Maltsev, another centre of the [[Nerchinsk katorga]]. Here the rules of detention were somewhat stricter, albeit surely not so extreme as in 'the regimes of punishment and mistreatment that "politicals" endured elsewhere' (including beatings, floggings and isolation in dark, freezing cells).&lt;ref&gt;William Bruce Lincoln, ''The conquest of a continent: Siberia and the Russians'', Ithaca/London: Cornell University Press, 2007, p. 279. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8922-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For the Maltsev women there was no forced labor, only enforced isolation from the outside world in which each day was like the next and the one that had gone before'.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 a young Ukrainian [[Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists|maximalist]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Irina Konstantinovna Kakhovskaya|ru|3=Каховская, Ирина Константиновна}} arrived at Maltsev. She had been convicted of involvement in a terrorist group. Kakhovskaya was a descendant of [[Decembrist]] revolutionary [[Pyotr Grigoryevich Kakhovsky]], who had been hanged in 1826 for assassinating Saint-Petersburg Governor [[Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich]], and another [[Grenadier]] officer. She formed a special friendship with Spiridonova and Izmailovich, a bond of political and personal sisterhood that would last throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, ''Narodniki women'', chapter 12: ''Political Heroines in the Gulag'', pp. 306 ff. After being finally released in the 1950s Kakhovskaya demanded in vain the full rehabilitation of her slain comrades. In 1959, at the age of 72, she insisted upon having a memorial she called ''Notes and Explanations'' ("Zapiski i Zaiavleniia") sent on to the Central Committee of the Communist party, to the Council of Ministers, and to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, with the sole aim of keeping alive the memory of her comrades' late years. It was mainly steadfast Kakhovskaya's credit that this memory was not completely lost.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1911, 28 female inmates, including Spiridonova, were transferred back to Akatuy where the conditions of their detention were further worsened, and they were forced to work in a bookbindery. The constant physical work, however, was eventually welcomed by the detainees, and made their prison life more tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Spiridonova'', p. 141 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left SR leader===
====Accommodation with the revolution====

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Spiridinova was released from incarceration at the women's Akatuy prison by a general amnesty covering imprisoned political criminals.&lt;ref name=Rab182 /&gt; According to [[Alexander Rabinowitch]], Spiridonova was widely esteemed by the common people of Russia, being venerated by many peasants as very nearly a [[saint]].&lt;ref name=Rab182 /&gt;

Spiridonova traveled from Siberia to Moscow to attend the 3rd National Congress of the [[Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries]] (the SRs) late in May 1917, but she was not elected to the governing Central Committee of the party.&lt;ref name=Rab182 /&gt; Despite this failure, Spiridonova became deeply involved in party affairs as a leader of the SR left wing and of the party's organization in the capital city of [[Petrograd]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pp. 182-183.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also involved in work helping to establish [[soviet (council)|soviets]] amongst the peasantry.&lt;ref name=Rab183&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], Spiridonova cast in her lot with the [[Left SRs]], who had split from their old party and sided with their erstwhile rivals of the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik Party]].&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt; She was extremely supportive of efforts to forge a unity government between the Bolsheviks, the Left SRs, and the other socialist parties represented in the Soviets, but when it proved impossible to reach a general agreement she supported the Left SRs entering into a coalition government with only the Bolsheviks. Her name was included by the railroad union ([[Vikzhel]]) in a list of possible candidate ministers for the unity government, but she did not take a ministerial role in the new Bolshevik-Left SR government. Instead she was appointed head of the Peasant Section of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee|Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviet of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies (VTsIK)]], making her nominally a chief official over peasant affairs.&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt; She was later one of a handful of Left SR leaders offering early support for [[V. I. Lenin|Lenin's]] decision to agree to the draconian peace terms offered by the government of [[Imperial Germany]] in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt; As the head of the Peasant Section of the VTsIK, Spiridonova appeared almost exclusively focused on winning the approval of the soviets and enforcement of an SR-inspired law of land socialization, constituting agrarian reform. The law was eventually passed on 19 February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnsdle.demon.co.uk/russ/land.html Translation of the Fundamental Law of Land Socialization].&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for some months she strived primarily to safeguard the alliance with the Bolsheviks, even at the cost of being temporarily sidelined within her own party.

On 18 January 1918, at the inaugural meeting of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] both the Left SRs and the Bolsheviks proposed Spiridonova as their candidate for the chair, but centrist SR [[Viktor Chernov|Víktor Mikhailovich Chernov]] was elected instead. The Assembly was dissolved for good after the end of that same first session.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, ''The Bolsheviks'', p. 114 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revolt against Bolshevism====
[[File:Maria Spiridonova.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Spiridonova at work as a Left SR leader]]
The honeymoon between Spiridonova (and the Left SRs generally) and the Bolsheviks was short-lived. Late in the spring of 1918 Bolshevik military detachments were formed to conduct forced requisitions of grain in a desperate effort to stave off famine in the cities amidst economic collapse.&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt; "The brutal Bolshevik grain-procurement policy and the devastating impact on the peasantry of the Soviet government's vast territorial and increasingly onerous economic concessions to Imperial Germany" caused widespread discontent in the countryside and the Peasant Section of the VTsIK was overwhelmed with complaints and protests. As head of the Section, Spiridonova was especially aware of the deepening misery of peasants throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Unity between Left SRs and Bolsheviks turned to rivalry over the future of the revolution and a competition ensued for control of the [[All-Russian_Congress_of_Soviets#Fifth_Congress|5th Congress of Soviets]], scheduled to begin in Moscow on 4 July 1918.&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt;

Historian [[Alexander Rabinowitch]] summarized the prelude to what he would later term "the suicide of the Left SRs" in his work on the first year of Soviet rule in Petrograd:&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, ''The Bolsheviks'', chapter 11, ''The Suicide of the Left SRs'', pp. 283-309.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote
|text=By this time popular disenchantment with Bolshevik rule was already well advanced, not only in rural but also in urban Russia. The primary beneficiaries of this nationwide grass-roots shift of public opinion were the Left SRs. During the second half of June 1918, it was an open question which of the two parties would have a majority at the Fifth All-Russians Congress of Soviets [...]&lt;br&gt;In this altogether uncertain and fluid situation, the Left SR Central Committee, at a meeting on 24 June chaired by Spiridonova, resolved to employ terrorism against high German officials, if necessary, to provoke immediate termination of the Brest treaty. In the evening of 4 July, virtually from the moment the Fifth Congress of Soviets opened in Moscow's [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theater]], it was clear to the Left SRs that the Bolsheviks had effectively "fabricated" a sizeable majority in the congress and consequently, that there was no hope whatever of utilizing it to force a fundamental change in the government's pro-German, antipeasant policies. Spiridonova and her colleagues now concluded that resolute action outside the congress along the line sanctioned by the Left SR Central Committee on 24 June was unavoidable.||author=Alexander Rabinovitch|title='Maria Spiridonova's "Last Testament";' ''The Russian Review'', Vol. 54, N. 3, July 1995, pp. 426-427}}

On 7 July 1918 two members of the Left SR Party, [[Iakov Bliumkin]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Nikolai Andreev (Left SR)|lt=Nicolai Andreev|ru|3=Андреев, Николай (эсер)}}, assassinated German [[ambassador]] [[Wilhelm Mirbach]].&lt;ref name=Rab183 /&gt; Spiridonova immediately assumed the "political" responsibility for the attack on behalf of the party's Central Committee. In her 1937 letter to the [[NKVD]] (see below), she claimed also to have directed the attack (even showing a sort of 'professional' pride).&lt;ref&gt;On 30 July 1918 in [[Kiev]] a Left SR combat group led by Kakhovskaya assassinated [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Hermann von Eichhorn]], the German military governor of [[Ukraine]] (Maxwell, ''Narodniki Women'', pp. 271 ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation did not evolve as the Left SR leadership had expected. Instead of fueling a new conflagration with Germany, Lenin used Mirbach's assassination as a pretext for the suppression of the Left SR organization: the terrorist attack was immediately portrayed as a straightforward [[Left SR uprising|uprising against Soviet power]], and troops rapidly isolated the army units supporting their former allies.&lt;ref name=Rab184&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pg. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiridonova rushed to the Bolshoi Theatre to take the floor before the ongoing 5th Congress of Soviets: she intended to explain and justify the Left SRs' political goals and plead for support, but found that the Congress had been suspended in the aftermath of the assassination and more than 400 Left SR delegates had been detained.&lt;ref name=Rab184 /&gt; Spiridonova and many other Left SR leaders were imprisoned in Moscow, her Peasant Section of the VTsIK was dissolved,&lt;ref name=Rab184 /&gt; and an undisclosed number of other party members (over 200 according to Spiridonova herself) were summarily shot.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

After she was kept in jail for several months, it was announced that Spiridonova was to be tried on 1 December 1918. To undercut the possibility of a potentially volatile situation developing a secret trial was conducted on 27 November instead.&lt;ref name=Rab184 /&gt; Spiridonova was sentenced to one year in prison for her part in the Left SR revolt but was amnestied the next day.

====Further imprisonment====

Spiridonova became the voice of a radical faction of the Left SRs opposed to any accommodation with the "Communist" regime (as the Bolsheviks now styled themselves) and she publicly denounced the government for having betrayed the revolution with its policies and actions.&lt;ref name=Rab185&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pg. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her bitter refusal to compromise, Spiridonova remained separate from the party's ultra-left terrorist wing, focusing on the idea of revitalizing the system of Soviets in opposition to the rule of the Communist party by bureaucratic edict.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt;

In January 1919, after another public speech in opposition to the Communist government, Spiridonova was arrested by the Moscow [[Cheka]].&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; She was tried once more on 24 February 1919, with ex [[Left communism#Russian left communism|Left Communist]] leader [[Nikolai Bukharin]] as the sole witness for the prosecution. Bukharin charged that Spiridonova was mentally ill and a menace to society in the deadly political atmosphere of the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; Spiridonova was found guilty and sentenced to one year's incarceration in a mental [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]], effectively removing her from politics.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt;

Instead of a sanitarium, Spiridonova was actually confined in a small holding cell inside a military [[barracks]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], where her already frail health rapidly deteriorated.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; Left SR militants organized her escape on 2 April 1919. Spiridonova subsequently lived underground in Moscow as a peasant woman under the [[pseudonym]] Onufrieva.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; She was rearrested 19 months later, ill with [[typhus]] and suffering from an unstated nervous disorder:&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; it was 'the night of October 26, 1920, exactly three years after the victory of the October Revolution'.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  This time, the Communist authorities proved somewhat more merciful than usual: given her extremely poor health, Spiridonova was initially put under house arrest. Alexandra Izmailovich was transferred from [[Butyrka prison]] and charged with nursing her, along with the party co-leader, [[Boris Kamkov]], then possibly Spiridonova's romantic partner as well.&lt;ref&gt;According to American [[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]]'s subjective impression — she spent a couple of days in hiding with Spiridonova and Kamkov in 1920 — small gestures by the former clearly betrayed them to be in love with each other even though neither did ever explicitly touch on the matter in front of her, or even hint at it (''L'épopée d'une anarchiste: New York 1886-Moscou 1920'', Bruxelles: Éditions Complexe, 1984 and 2002, pp. 253-254, {{ISBN|2-87027-898-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Kamkov was with her at the moment of arrest and was permitted to stay beside her for the next four months.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Spiridonova'', p. 265 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; She was later transferred to a [[Cheka]] medical facility, then confined in a psychiatric prison.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt;

She was finally released to the custody of two Left SR comrades&lt;ref&gt;They were the secretary of the central bureau of the Left SRs (legalists), {{Interlanguage link multi|Ilya Bakkal|lt=Ilya Yurievich Bakkal|ru|3=Баккал, Илья Юрьевич}}, and the erstwhile People's Commissar for Justice and Spiridonova's future biographer, [[Isaac Steinberg|Isaac Nachman Steinberg]] (Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 429).&lt;/ref&gt; on 18 November 1921 under the condition that she cease and desist all political activity.&lt;ref name=Rab185 /&gt; Historian [[Alexander Rabinowitch]] comments that there is no evidence that she ever violated this condition.&lt;ref name=Rab186&gt;Rabinowitch, "Spiridonova," pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiridonova's active political life was at an end.

=== Persecution, death and legacy ===

Despite her withdrawal from active politics, she was arrested again on 16 May 1923. At the time large numbers of moderate socialist and liberal leaders were permitted or obliged to emigrate to the West (including the two [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]] to whom Spiridonova had been entrusted). Nevertheless Spiridonova was charged with "having made preparations to flee abroad" and sentenced to three years of administrative exile, a sentence that was repeatedly extended. She spent the rest of the 1920s in [[Kaluga]] (1923-25), [[Samarkand]] (1925-28) and [[Tashkent]] (1928-30). In 1930, after [[Stalin]]'s consolidation of power, Spiridonova was arrested once again. Charged with maintaining contacts abroad, she was sentenced to three more years of administrative exile (twice extended), this time in [[Ufa]], capital of the [[Bashkir Republic]]. She lived with her former prison partner Izmailovich during the whole period of exile. Kakhovskaya also spent time with them as often and as long as she was permitted to. In the mid 1920s Spiridonova had also married her fellow exile {{Interlanguage link multi|Ilya Andreevich Mayorov|ru|3=Майоров, Илья Андреевич}},&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, "Last Testament", p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; a Left SR leader of peasant origin and erstwhile Deputy People's Commissar for Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, ''Spiridonova'', "Illustrations", p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Spiridonova was arrested yet again, with several former party comrades including her husband, her teenaged stepson, her invalid father-in-law, Alexandra Izmailovich, Irina Kakhovskaya and the latter's aged aunt. The group was accused of plotting to create a united counter-revolutionary center and to assassinate Bashkir Communist leaders. Spiridonova underwent cruel interrogation in prison in Ufa and in Moscow for several months, without admitting any guilt, although a confession was extorted from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;According to the inquisitors of Spiridonova, Mayorov was threatened that his minor son and his sick aged father would be both interned for five years in a labour camp, and was eventually forced into signing his confession while 'wailing like a baby'. 'Mayorov crying?' wondered Spiridonova, 'In my nineteen years with him I had never seen him shed a tear, much less cry out loud. "What have you done to him?"' (Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 438). Both Izmailovich and Kakhovskaya refused either to confess anything or to accuse anybody.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937 she wrote a long letter to the 4th Section of the [[Main Directorate of State Security|Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB)]] within the [[NKVD|People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD)]] from her cell, protesting against the prison treatment inflicted on her, contesting the correctness of the judicial procedure and rejecting every single charge.&lt;ref&gt;The original text in Russian is available online at the [[Sakharov Center]] website: [http://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=page&amp;num=864 «Проявите гуманность и убейте сразу…» : Письмо М. А. Спиридоновой] (''"Be humane and kill me now ...": a letter from M.A. Spiridonova''). Large excerpts translated into English are quoted in Rabinovich's cited essay, 'Maria Spiridonova's "Last Testament"'.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter proclaimed that she fully supported the construction of socialism and acknowledged the Communist leadership. However, she concluded what was later called her 'last testament' with a vibrant heart-felt plea against capital punishment, twice abolished in the aftermaths of the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s and twice re-established by subsequent governments despite vehement protests from the Left Social-Revolutionaries:

{{Quote
|text=I only disagree with the fact that the death penalty remains in our system. Today the State is powerful enough to build socialism without resorting to the death penalty and should not include such a statute among its laws. [...] The best thoughts of humanity and the passionate work of hearts and minds for centuries on end have seen the elimination of this institution as a crowning achievement. The axe, the guillotine, the rope, the bullet, and the electric chair are representative of the [[Middle Ages]]. [...]

It is permissible and necessary to kill in a civil war while protecting the rights of the revolution and the working class, but only when there are no other means at hand to defend the revolution. When, however, powerful means of defense such as we have exist, capital punishment becomes an institution of evil, corrupting in countless ways those who make use of it.

I think constantly about the psychology of thousands of people, about those dealing with technical questions, the executioners, members of the firing squads, those who conduct the condemned to their deaths, about the platoon of soldiers shooting in the semidarkness at the bound, defenseless, and half-crazed prisoner. This should never, never be permitted in our country. We have apple blossoms in our country, we have motion and science, art, beauty, we have books and universal education and health care, we have the sun and children to raise, we have truth. And together with all this we have this enormous corner where cruel and bloody deeds are performed. In connection with this question, I often think of Stalin, who is, after all, an intelligent man, seemingly interested in the transformation of objects and hearts. How is it that he does not see that the death penalty must be abolished?! You started using this death penalty with us Left SRs and you should end it with us, restricting its scope to my person, who, as you assert, has not been disarmed. But you must put an end to the death penalty. [...]

On 7 January 1938, she was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison by the [[Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union|Military Collegium of the Supreme Court]]. After a hunger strike, she was held in isolation at [[Oryol Prison]]. On 11 September 1941 (three months after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]]), Spiridonova, Izmailovich, Mayorov and over 150 other political prisoners (among them [[Christian Rakovsky]] and [[Olga Kameneva]]), were executed by order of Stalin in the [[Medvedev Forest massacre|Medvedevsky Forest massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Kakhovskaya's efforts after the 1956 [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], "not until 1990 were the 1941 charges against Spiridonova rescinded [...] Finally, in 1992, [she] was exonerated of the charges for which she had been imprisoned and exiled beginning in 1918, and was fully rehabilitated." The exact burial place of the Medvedevsky Forest victims has never been found.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitch, 'Last Testament', p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdullah Shah''' (1965–2004) was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[serial killer]] found guilty in [[Kabul]] of killing more than 20 people, including his wife.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Former Afghan commander executed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3662935.stm  |date=27 April 2004 |work=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]] |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sanctioned execution was the first in [[Afghanistan]] since the fall of the [[Taliban]] in late 2001.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Shah served under [[Zardad Khan]]—even earning the nickname '''Zardad's dog'''— who served under [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] in the [[civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Shah and Zardad robbed travelers on the road from Kabul to [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]].

Shah was first convicted in special court proceedings in October 2002. Nine people testified against him at the trial, including another wife he tried to set on fire. The bodies of many of Shah's victims were found in a well in [[Paghman District]].

The execution took place in the [[Pul-e-Charkhi jail]]. Interim president [[Hamid Karzai]] signed the death warrant.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; At the execution, Shah was shot in the back of the head. Witnesses present included representatives of the Afghan police, the Attorney General's office and doctors.

[[Amnesty International]] protested against the execution claiming Afghanistan avoided basic standards of fairness. The organization added that Shah was probably silenced so he could not testify against commanders allied to the government.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It said he was not provided a defense attorney, the trial was secret, a confession was obtained under torture and the first judge in his case was dismissed for taking a bribe. The second judge came under pressure from the Supreme Court to impose the sentence.

'''Cayetano Santos Godino''' (October 31, 1896 – November 15, 1944), also known as '''"El Petiso Orejudo"''' ("The Big-Eared Midget"), was an Argentinian [[serial killer]] who terrorized [[Buenos Aires]] at the age of 16. In the early 20th century, he was responsible for the [[murder]] of four children, the [[attempted murder]] of another seven children, and seven counts of [[arson]].

==Early life==
Godino was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, one of eight boys. His father and mother, Fiore Godino and Lucia Ruffo, were alcoholics and abusive. Godino's father contracted [[syphilis]] before Godino was born, causing Godino to experience serious childhood health problems.&lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casoabierto.com/reportajes/cronica-negra/cayetano-santos-godino-la-historia-del-petiso-orejudo.html |title=Cayetano Santos Godino, la historia del Petiso Orejudo |last=Cabezas López |first=Carlos |date=2007-09-16 |work=Caso Abierto |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801214210/http://www.casoabierto.com/reportajes/cronica-negra/cayetano-santos-godino-la-historia-del-petiso-orejudo.html |archivedate=2008-08-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Early signs of social mismanagement ==
Starting in childhood, Godino killed cats and birds, and enjoyed playing with fire. His violent behavior and lack of interest in education caused him to move from school to school.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

When he was seven years old, Godino beat two-year-old Miguel de Paoli and threw him into a ditch. A nearby official saw this and led the children to the police station, where their mothers picked them up a few hours later.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

A year later, Godino beat Ana Neri, a child in his neighborhood, with a stone. A police officer intervened, but Godino was released from jail due to his young age.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt;

When he was 10, Godino's parents discovered his compulsive [[masturbation]]. Not knowing what to do with him, his mother told the police, resulting in a two-month jail term for him&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; as masturbation was illegal at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Penal Code of the United States of Brazil |type=Decree |number=847 |language=Portuguese |date=11 October 1890 |article=282 |articletype=Article |url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/decret/1824-1899/decreto-847-11-outubro-1890-503086-publicacaooriginal-1-pe.html |accessdate=24 November 2017}} Printed in [http://bd.camara.gov.br/bd/bitstream/handle/bdcamara/19080/colleccao_leis_1890_parte2.pdf.pdf ''Coleção de Leis dea République do Brasil: Premeiro Fasciculo''] 10:2664, 2710 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime spree ==
On January 17, 1912, Godino set fire to a warehouse on Corrientes Street. When he was arrested, he told police, "I like to see firemen working. It's nice to see how they fall into the fire."&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; On January 26, 1912, Arturo Laurona, 13, was found dead in an abandoned house. A few months later, on March 7, 1912, Godino set fire to the dress of Reyna Vainicoff, 5, who did not recover and died some days later.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In late September 1912, he set fire to a railway station, though the fire was extinguished without extensive damage. On November 8, 1912, he tried to choke 8-year-old Roberto Russo. He was [[arrest]]ed and charged with attempted murder, but was released until the trial. On November 16, 1912, he assaulted a three-year-old, Carmen Ghittoni, who suffered minor wounds before a police officer intervened and Godino ran off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://foro.cuandocalientaelsol.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;p=272817 |title=Cayetano Santos Godino, el precoz "Petiso Orejudo" |date=2010-11-02 |website=Foro Cuando calienta el sol |language=es |access-date=2016-02-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223094018/http://foro.cuandocalientaelsol.net/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;p=272817 |archive-date=2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 1912, he [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] two-year-old Carolina Neolener, who cried out and was rescued by a neighbour. Later in the same month, he set fire to two large sheds, but the fires were quickly extinguished.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On December 3, 1912, Godino saw 18-month-old Jesualdo Giordano playing outside his house and offered to buy the boy some sweets to convince him to go with him. Providing a few sweets then offering more, Godino took Giordano to a country house. When they were inside, he threw him to the floor and unsuccessfully tried to choke him with his belt. Then he cut his belt and tied his hands and legs. He started beating him and considered hammering his head. He left the house looking for a nail and saw Giordano's father, to whom he said he did not know where the child was. He then re-entered the house with the nail. He hammered it into the side of Giordano's skull and hid the corpse.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The body was found by the father minutes later. At 8:00 PM, Godino went to the wake and touched the skull where he had fixed the nail. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 4, 1912, he was arrested by police, confessing his crimes.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Jail==
On January 4, 1913, he entered a [[reformatory]], where he tried to kill some of the inmates. Because medical reports declared him insane, the judge discontinued the case and ordered him to stay in the reformatory. On November 12, 1915, an appeal was approved ordering him to be moved to jail on November 20.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On March 28, 1923, Godino was transferred to [[Ushuaia]] Penitentiary. Throughout 1933 he spent some time in the hospital for a beating he suffered from inmates after he killed two of their pet cats. From 1935 onwards, he was always ill and received no visitors until he died on November 15, 1944 under suspicious circumstances.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Arnold Karl Sodeman''' ({{Birth date|1899|12|12|df=y}} – {{Death date|1936|6|1|df=y}}), also known as the '''School-girl Strangler''', was an [[Australian]] [[serial killer]] who targeted children. He confessed to four killings before being executed at [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1936. Sodeman was the second of eleven people to be hanged at Pentridge Prison after the closure of [[Melbourne Gaol]] in 1929.

==Early life==
Arnold Karl Sodeman was born in Victoria in 1899. His mother suffered from bouts of amnesia and both his father and grandfather died in mental institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/SuggestLogon.asp|title=RecordSearch|last=|first=|date=|website=recordsearch.naa.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18, Sodeman was sent to a reformatory prison for larceny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1408956?searchTerm=Arnold+Sodeman |title=30 Aug 1918 - SENT TO REFORMATORY |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1918-08-30 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his release from the reformatory, he was charged with armed robbery and wounding the station master at [[Surrey Hills railway station]]. Sodeman was sent to prison to serve three years hard labour. Sodeman escaped from prison and was sentenced to a further 12 months imprisonment with hard-labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anderson Inlet Inverloch : murder in Inverloch : the Sodeman murders|last=Sartain|first=Bob|publisher=Norman R. Deacon for Inverloch Historical Society|year=1999|isbn=1876594004|location=Inverloch, Victoria, Australia|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stitcher.com/s?eid=48842586|title=Felon - S2E1 - The Schoolgirl Strangler from Felon True Crime|website=www.stitcher.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release, Sodeman settled down to various labouring jobs, first in Melbourne, and later in [[Gippsland]]. He married Bernice Pope at Collingwood and their daughter, Joan, was born in 1928. The marriage was considered a happy one; although Sodeman seemed to suffer from occasional bouts of depression and frequent drunkenness, he was never violent towards his family. He was reported{{by whom|date=April 2012}} to be hard-working, mild and amiable, with a generous disposition.

==Murders and arrest==
On 9 November 1930, Sodeman abducted a 12-year-old schoolgirl, Mena Griffiths. He came upon his victim at the local playground playing with a group of friends. He gave the other girls some money, and told them to go to the shop to get some ice-creams; meanwhile, he told his victim that he had a different errand for her to run. By the time the little girl's friends returned to the playground, there was no sign of Griffiths or the man. Griffiths' body was discovered two days later at [[Ormond, Victoria|Ormond]], in an abandoned building. She had been strangled to death, then gagged and bound post-mortem with her own clothing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 10 January 1931, he abducted 16-year-old Hazel Wilson and strangled her to death. Her body was also found in the suburb of Ormond. Again, in a signature move, he had gagged and tied her hands behind her back with portions of her clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2407086 |title=18 Feb 1936 - FOUR CONFESSIONS TO MURDER MELBOURNE, Monday |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodeman struck for the third time on 1 January 1935. His victim, Ethel Belshaw, was a 12-year-old girl whom he strangled then bound at the sea-side town of [[Inverloch, Victoria|Inverloch]]. Belshaw was intending to buy an ice cream when she disappeared.

On 1 December 1935, Sodeman killed his fourth victim, a 6-year-old girl named June Rushmer, the daughter of a coworker, who was taken from a local park. Her body was found the following day less than {{convert|2|km|mi}} from her [[Leongatha, Victoria|Leongatha]] home. She had also been bound, gagged and strangled. Witnesses stated that they had seen the child with a man on a bicycle shortly before her disappearance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sodeman at the time was on a work crew repairing roadways. During a morning [[tea break]] a fellow worker jokingly stated he had seen Sodeman on his bike near the crime scene. Sodeman replied angrily that he wasn't there. He had answered with such anger and rage, which was very out of character for him, that the workers told police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Police took him away for questioning and he quickly confessed to the crimes. Police were initially skeptical of the confession, but Sodeman gave details of the crimes that only someone present could have known.

== Inquest and trial ==
The court house at Leongatha was crowded when the Rushmer inquest commenced. The government pathologist, Dr. Mollison, said that the dead girl's hands were tied behind her back with a piece of cloth, and a bloodstained garment was pushed into her mouth. A piece of torn sock was tied around her neck. The body bore bruises. Death, he thought was due to suffocation.

Nancy Viola Smith, aged 12, said that she played with Rushmer on the Leongatha reserve and that Rushmer left the park at 7.15 p.m. William Henry Money, of Leongatha said that at 7.15 p.m. he saw Sodeman riding his bicycle in the direction of the reserve. Sodeman had a strange look on his face and the witness thought it peculiar. Sodeman did not speak to him. Vincent Desmond Ryan of Leongatha, said that between 7.15 and 7.30 p.m. he saw a man with a little girl on the front of his cycle. The child was similar in build to Rushmer, but the witness was 80 metres (90 yards) away and could not see him properly.

Senior Detective O'Keefe said that Detective Delminico was with Sodeman when he stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I saw June Rushmer on the footpath walking towards her home near the tennis court and she said, 'Give us a ride.' I knew her and she knew me. I agreed, and rode down the stock route and turned down the road leading to the sanitary depot. About 90 metres (100 yards) from the corner, she said, 'This is far enough.' I got off the bike and said 'You can walk home.' I made a run towards her and she ran into the bush. I ran after her, and caught her round the neck, and she started to scream. I held her by the neck and she went limp all of a sudden. I then took off her bloomers and jammed them into her mouth. I got a belt from her frock and tied it over her mouth and round the back of her neck." &lt;/blockquote&gt;Sodeman was then committed for trial by the coroner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11869594?searchTerm=Arnold+Sodeman |title=01 Jan 1936 - DEATH OF CHILD AT LEONGATHA EVIDENCE AT INQUEST |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1936, at the conclusion of a two-day trial, the jury found him guilty of murder. The government medical officer, Dr A. J. W. Philpott, his assistant, Dr R. T. Allan, and a psychiatrist Dr [[Reginald Spencer Ellery|Reginald Ellery]] all gave evidence that Sodeman was suffering from a disorder of the mind which created an 'obsessional impulse' of such power that—under the influence of alcohol—he was no longer responsible for his behaviour. Since Sodeman was intoxicated on all four occasions, the doctors concluded that he was insane at the times of the murders. Their conclusion was reinforced not only by Sodeman's repetitive behaviour, but also by his family's medical history: both his father and grandfather had died insane. Judge Charles Gavan Duffy then sentenced him to death for the murder of Rushmer having advised the jury to distinguish between opinions given by expert medical witnesses on matters relating to the physical body, which could be proved by surgery, and those concerning the mind. The jury, in making their decision,  rejected Sodeman's defence of insanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Appeals==
An extract from ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', on Friday 24 April 1936, read:&lt;blockquote&gt;"An English King's Counsel has now been engaged to plead the case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Arnold Sodeman, who has been condemned to death for the murder of June Rushmer at Leongatha. Sodeman's solicitor (Mr. C H. Auty) said yesterday that he had arranged by cable message for Mr D. N Pritt, K C, a leading Kings Counsel, and a member of the House of Commons, to appear for Sodeman in the proposed application by him for special leave to appeal against the refusal of the High Court of Australia to grant him special leave to appeal against his conviction. Mr Auty said that his agents in London would instruct Mr. Pritt and another barrister, who would act as Mr Pritt's Junior, regarding the details of the application. Meanwhile, Mr. Auty has addressed a written request to the Premier Mr. Dunstan) that the Government should grant a further reprieve to Sodeman until such time as the condemned man's application to the Privy Council has been determined Mr Auty said yesterday that he was now 'preparing the petition for special leave to appeal and other necessary documents. He expected that those documents would be ready in time to be despatched to England next week'. One of the documents which must shortly go forward to London is an affidavit in support of the application. This must be signed by Sodeman, whose present reprieve expires on May 4, for which day the execution has been fixed. It is expected that the Executive Council will grant the reprieve now asked for by Mr. Auty. It is expected that a report will be received from the Crown Law Department next week, and if the Cabinet decides that the request should be granted the necessary action will be taken immediately by the Executive Council. Sodeman's appeal against his conviction was unsuccessful. The grounds of the appeal were:-(1) That the learned trial Judge wrongly admitted evidence, namely, the evidence of the deaths of Mena Griffiths, Hazel Wilson, and Ethel Belshaw; (2) that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury (a) as to the onus of proof in a case of insanity, (b) as to the requirements of the law in relation to insanity, and (c) as to the law relating to drink, insanity, and manslaughter; and (3) that the prosecution and the learned trial Judge made comments on the failure of the accused to give evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11884195?searchTerm=Arnold+Karl+Sodeman |title=21 Feb 1936 - SODEMAN'S APPEAL Notice Lodged in Court Will be |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1936-02-21 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Execution==
Sodeman had not wanted a reprieve because of the fear that if he lived he may have committed more murders. Sodeman spent a good deal of his time playing draughts with [[Edward Cornelius]], who was under sentence of death for the murder of the Rev. Cecil in Fitzroy in November of last year.&lt;ref name="trove.nla.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2416859?searchTerm=Arnold+Karl+Sodeman |title=02 Jun 1936 - SODEMAN HANGED Quadruple Murderer Pays for Crime |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=1936-06-02 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hanged and buried at [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], Coburg, on 1 June 1936. An autopsy disclosed that he was suffering from [[leptomeningitis]], a degenerative disease which could cause serious congestion of the brain when aggravated by alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=George |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120011b.htm |title=Biography - Arnold Karl Sodeman - Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In 1965, the Australian television series ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' based episode 39, "A Lonely Place", on the case. The episode first went to air in November 1965, and was introduced by actor [[John Fegan (actor)|John Fegan]] warning of the importance of protecting children. Unlike many episodes, the episode ended without a voice over, stating what the legal results of the case had been (for example, whether the offender was sentenced to death but later reprieved).

On the seventy-fifth anniversary of the murder of Ethel Belshaw, Leongatha newspaper ‘’’''The Great Southern Star''’’’ published an interview with Maureen Lewis (née Keighery) who was the Soderman's neighbour in 1935. Lewis was with the Sodeman family on the same day he murdered Belshaw. Lewis had travelled with the Sodemans from Leongatha, for a fun day in the sun. She was friends with the Sodemans’ child, Joan, a girl of similar age. “On the day Ethel was murdered he wanted to take me for an ice cream. It could have been me that day,” she said. “I went down there with them to Inverloch on that day with the Sodemans. ... He wanted to take me for an ice cream and Mrs Sodeman wouldn’t let him take me unless he also took Joan, his daughter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dunn|first=Matt|title=Cheating death: 75 years on, 'Gatha woman reveals lucky escape from serial killer|date=2010-01-12|work=The great southern star}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which Sodeman refused to do).

'''Harald Sassak'''&amp;nbsp;(born 1948; died August 21, 2013&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;[[Weitra]]&lt;ref name=work&gt;[http://www.noen.at/lokales/noe-uebersicht/gmuend/aktuell/Gaskassier-Sassak-starb-in-Weitra;art2511,480360 „Gaskassier“ Sassak starb in Weitra].&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Austria]]n&amp;nbsp;[[serial killer]] who went into criminal history as a gas assassin. He was also the longest-serving of Austrian imprisoned convicts. In the years 1971 and 1972 he committed, inter alia, six killings out of greed and served a [[life sentence]] in prison for them.

== Life ==
Harald Sassak was the son of a bricklayer and an operator. He learned as a plumber and did his military service in the army from 1966 to 1969 in the [[Lainz]] hospital as an auxiliary. After he suffered from [[jaundice]], he did not bring his employer medical confirmation and was therefore dismissed. He also gave up his subsequent job as a confectioner. He was described as very friendly and helpful by his family, friends and superiors. He always very well in school and did not receive any disciplinary sanctions from the army.

When one day an elderly woman approached him, asking him if he could repair her gas appliance and then tipped him, he developed an idea he called the "gas trick."

Between August 31, 1970 and February 12, 1972, he spent time with elderly people as a servant of the [[gasworks]], who wanted to check their equipment. As soon as he knew where the covert funds were, he diverted his victim, for example, by asking for a glass of water. If caught in the act, he killed his victim and fled. In some raids his accomplice Johann Sharaditsch, whom he had met in a liquor room, helped him.

Surviving victims said that a chubby, nice man had asked for admission with the words: "The gas man is here!". He was always well dressed, and had a seemingly valid identity card and expertise. Only after the victims revealed their money caches did he strike them down and rob them. Except for a single fingerprint, which could not be assigned to any person from the police files, no trace of the offender was left. However, when a neighbour of one of the victims, a graphic designer, had a very accurate facial composite of the perpetrator made by the draftsman of the bureau, the search became more concrete. A waiter of the Reiser hotel recognized the man as Harald Sassak by the facial composite and led the officials to the culprit, who was drinking a glass of wine. One of his victims identified him at the hotel and Sassak was arrested. On the way to the office he confessed to his crimes.

On January 22, 1974, Sassak's trial began, with the reading of the indictment taking more than an hour. He confessed to his crimes, but claimed he did not participate in any murders. The coroner said that 79-year old Richard Langer and 86-year old Josefa Fierlinger died as a direct result of the violence. 69-year old Aloisia Meschnark died of kidney failure 17 days after being hospitalized, 66-year old Rosa Schwarz after seven days of brain soreness, 86-year old Maria Aberle and 85-year old Eleonore Hauer after ten or 38 days of pneumonia. According to the report, there was a connection between the death of women and the use of force. Gabriele Hammer, who died 54 days after being attacked by Sassak, could no longer find evidence of violence.

On February 7, 1974, Sassak was convicted of robbing Josefa Fierlinger, the predatory manslaughter of Richard Langer, Aloisia Meschnark, Rosa Schwarz, Maria Aberle and Eleonore Hauer, as well as robbery and theft in nine cases, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. His accomplice, Johann Sharaditsch, was guilty of theft, robbery in two cases and theft in two cases and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.&lt;ref name=work /&gt;

Sassak died on August 21, 2013, as a result of prolonged illness in a [[Lower Austria]]n nursing home, after being released from prison shortly after more than being 39 years behind bars.

'''Hugo Schenk''' (born February 11, 1849, in [[Čechy pod Kosířem]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://actapublica.eu/matriky/brno/prohlizec/5576/?strana=57 |title=Geburtsbuch |trans-title=Register of births |date=1849 |website=Moravský zemský archiv Brno [Moravian Regional Archive Brno] |language=de |access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; died April 22, 1884 in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[serial killer]] and imposter who murdered four maids with the help of his accomplice, Karl Schlossarek (1858 - 1884).

== Activities ==
Hugo Schenk was born into a well-off family as a son of a judge working in [[Cieszyn]]. His brother worked as a community doctor in [[Maria Taferl]]. In 1869 and 1870 he began his criminal life as an escapee from the henchmen of the [[Tsar]] from [[Warsaw]], Prince Boleslav von Wilopolsky, and was tried as a marriage swindler to get the dowry of the alleged brides. Sentenced on December 5, 1870, to a five-year stay at the [[Mírov]] detention center for a number of serious frauds, but was pardoned and released after two years.

At the age of 32, he was once again convicted of marital fraud for two years in a heavy dungeon at the Stein Prison. In prison he met Karl Schlossarek, who was imprisoned for theft. After his release in January 1883 Schenk met the 34-year old Josefine Timal, who worked as a maid in Vienna, where he worked as a railway engineer and promised her marriage. Timal gave into his confidence, quit her job, packed all her valuables and drove with him to the alleged honeymoon to [[Kraków]]. However, he raped her near the [[Hranice Abyss]]. With the help of Schlossarek, he gagged and tied Timal, robbed her of valuables and sank her with a heavy stone into the abyss.

Because Schenk was of the opinion that her aunt Katharina, who worked as a maid in [[České Budějovice|Budweis]], could notice her niece's disappearance, he also planned to kill her. He wrote to her that he had married Josefine and invited her to his estate. On June 21, 1883, he picked her up from the station and drove her to [[Krummnußbaum]], where he overpowered and killed her along the banks of the [[Danube]], along with Schlossarek. After taking all her valuables, they sank Katharina into the Danube. Only six weeks later Schenk murdered the maid Theresia Ketterl in a gorge in [[Lilienfeld]] to get her valuables. On December 28, 1883, the duo murdered and buried maid Rosa Ferenszi in the Danube at [[Kittsee]] to rob her.

== Execution ==
On January 10, 1884, Hugo Schenk was arrested, and just a day later - Karl Schlossarek. Both were [[sentenced to death]] by hanging and executed on April 22, 1884, in Court No. 1 of the Vienna Regional Court.

== Legacy ==
The skull of Hugo Schenk, which was autopsied and neurologically examined after the execution by Viennese neurologist [[Moritz Benedikt]], is in the Vienna Criminal Museum. The writer [[Egon Kisch]] (1885 - 1948) has dealt with the story of a woman who survived Schenk's attack.

'''Michaiah Shobek''' (born 1954 as '''James Michael Shoffner''' - October 19, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] who murdered three fellow American tourists in the Bahamas from December 1973 to January 1974.&lt;ref name=put&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/07/archives/americans-hanging-in-bahamas-put-off.html|title=American's Hanging in Bahamas Put Off|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=7 October 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=off&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/19/archives/bahamas-to-execute-an-american-today-for-murder-of-3-tourists.html|title=Bahamas to Execute an American Today for Murder of 3 Tourists|publisher=Associated Press|date=19 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently executed for his crimes.

==Biography==
Born James Michael Shoffner in Milwaukee, Shobek grew up with his mother Juanita Spencer, a cleaner at a Milwaukee school, without knowing his father. He caught a [[viral disease]] when he was two years old, suffering permanent brain damage from it.&lt;ref name=put/&gt; As an adult, he began working as a handyman, dreaming of one day becoming a songwriter.&lt;ref name=hang&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://cmuhistory.cmich.edu/cgi-bin/cmuhistory?a=d&amp;d=IsabellaCML19761020.1.2|title=American hanged|publisher=[[Central Michigan Life]]|date=20 October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1973, the then 17-year-old moved to the Bahamas to "bum around", changing his name to Michaiah Shobek.&lt;ref name=lucifer&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://bahamianology.com/bahamas-serial-killers-part-2-the-angels-of-lucifer-killer-1974/|title=Bahamas Serial Killers (part 2): The "Angels of Lucifer" Killer 1974|publisher=Bahamianology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murders===
On December 5, 1973, he murdered his first victim, 50-year-old Paul V. Howell, an attorney from [[Massillon, Ohio]] who was attending a convention. On Wednesday evening, Howell was in his hotel room, when he heard a surprising knock on his door. Immediately upon opening it, he was stabbed in the chest and throat, killed instantly. Police suspected that he may have surprised burglars, and focused on that theory, while Howell's body was sent off for preparation of funeral services in native Ohio.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

On January 18 the following year, Shobek murdered his second victim - 44-year-old Irvin Bernstein from [[Ocean City, New Jersey]], an accountant working for the Ministry of Fisheries. The man had arrived in Nassau from [[Miami]] through an Air Bahamas flight the previous day, with Shobek spotting him and offering a ride. He drove Bernstein from the airport, faking sexual advances to distract the man from noticing that they weren't going to the hotel.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

When he stopped the car and pulled out his knife, Bernstein opened the door and tried to escape, but was caught and stabbed to death by his assailant. His body was discovered on Yamacraw Beach the next day, only with socks and shoes on, with multiple stab wounds. A pen and pair of sunglasses belonging to Shobek were found next to the body, while a black bag found in [[Paradise Island]] 8 miles away from there contained some of Bernstein's papers and his killer's driver's license. When he was arrested later on, Shobek was found to be in possession of Bernstein's pen.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

On January 26, he murdered his final victim - 17-year-old student Katie Smith from [[Detroit]], who was on a visit to the Bahamas with a group of other [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] students. The day before her murder, she had been seen walking with Shobek, and the following day, her body was found in a ditch by a cardboard box, apparently strangled to death.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

===Arrest, trial and execution===
Shobek was eventually arrested for murdering Bernstein, but his trial was delayed, as there was a bank robbery investigation going on at the time.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt; When it was resumed in 1975, he confessed to the other murders, claiming that they were "angels of Lucifer", and that he had murdered them by order from God. Although initially sentenced to be hanged on October 8 solely for Bernstein's murder, he was granted an indefinite stay following an appeal filed by the United States Embassy, in which it was claimed that substantial information hadn't been supplied to the court.&lt;ref name=put/&gt;&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

During a psychiatric examination, the authorities learned that Shobek had travelled between the USA and the Bahamas for about two years. Whether he murdered other people during this period is unknown.&lt;ref name=lucifer/&gt;

Shobek's execution date was moved to October 19, when he was to be executed at the Fox Hill Prison.&lt;ref name=off/&gt; The day before the hanging, a lawyer from the [[Legal Aid Society]] representing Shobek's mother had pled to then-president [[Gerald Ford]] to make a last-minute appeal, but the request was refused by a presidential aide. And thus, Michaiah Shobek was hanged, his death later being confirmed by the Investigation Department Chief Addington Darville. At that point, he was the first American to be hanged in the Bahamas in 15 years.&lt;ref name=hang/&gt;

'''Ershad Sikder''' (died 10 May 2004) was a Bangladeshi criminal and [[serial killer]], known for committing various crimes such as murder, torture, theft, robbery and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights-china.org/zt/international/200402004115162018.htm{{অকার্যকর সংযোগ|তারিখ=জানুয়ারি ২০১৯ |bot=InternetArchiveBot |ঠিক করার প্রচেষ্টা=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/67211|title=Letter from America: Thoughts on Bangladesh – 6|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to death for murder, and subsequently executed on May 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="dstar"&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/04/21/d40421011818.htm Ershad Shikdar to be hanged on May 10], ডেইলী স্টার, বাংলাদেশ, এপ্রিল ২১, ২০০৪।&lt;/ref&gt;

A song by Abdus Sattar Mohantan, titled "I will be dead", has been popularized throughout the country as Sikder's song.&lt;ref name="song"&gt;[http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jun/20/time.html Orchestra presents Sritimoy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005943/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/jun/20/time.html |date=2007-09-28 }}, নিউ এইজ, বাংলাদেশ, জুন ২০, ২০০৫।&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Sikder was born in the Madargona village of Nalchity Upazila, Jhalokati District. His father was Bande Ali. Between 1966–1967, Sikder moved from his birthplace to the Khulna District.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bd-pratidin.com/2013/12/15/32247&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Khulna, Ershad worked as a railway worker for some time. From there, he began gradually robbing along the railway lines and joined a gang. Later, he formed his own gang and earned the name ''Ranga Chora'' from the locals.

Between 1976 and 1977, he formed another gang named ''Ramada Bahini'', which was involved in theft, robberies and terrorist activities along the Khulna Railway Station and the Ghat area. Together with his gang, Ershad occupied the 4th and 5th areas of Ghat, making it his exclusive regulator.

=== Entry into politics ===
In 1982, after the fall of former president [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]], Sikder entered politics through the [[Bangladesh Jatiya Party|Jatiya Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3702003.stm|title=BBC NEWS - South Asia - Bangladesh serial killer hanged|publisher=|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1988 election during the military rule, Sikder was elected as the Commissioner of Ward 8. After forming the BNP government in 1991, Sikder joined it. On December 26, 1996, he again changed his party to the [[Awami League]], but soon after being criticized, he was expelled. At the time of his 1999 arrest, he was still the Commissioner of Ward 8.

=== Criminal acts and murders ===
After entering politics, Sikder's power grew. From 1984 to 1986, he was involved in the possession of Khulna properties, occupying private property, the drug trade, extortion and other criminal activities. In 1991, he drove out the owner of an ice factory named Rafiq, from the 4th Ghat area, appropriated the ice factory and forced all traders to buy ice from him.

It is also known that he used the ice factory as his torture center. Ershad was accused of more than 60 murders, together with one of his collaborators, Rajasakshi Nure Alam. The latter later gave a statement in the court describing 24 killings, further claiming that Sikder has more than 70 victims, although only one weapon was recovered from his house, known as the "Swarnakamal".

=== Personal life ===
It is known that Sikder was married six times. His first wife was Khodeja Begum, whom he married in 1973. Another wife, named Sanjida Akter Shobha, received a luxurious gold house. Aside from them, there were a Taslima of Rupsha Rajapur village, a Farida of Bagerhat, [[Rampal Upazila]]; another unknown wife and a Durgargaire of Pyakgacha.

'''Alexander Vasilyevich Sergeychik''' ({{Lang-be|Аляксандар Васільевіч Сяргейчык}}, b. 1970, d. November 26, 2007) was a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] [[serial killer]]. He committed murders between 2000 and 2006 in [[Shchuchyn District]] and [[Grodno District]]. He confessed to killing a total of twelve people, however, the investigation could only bring forward enough evidence to convict him of six murders. He was sentenced to death by the court.&lt;ref&gt;Чаровская К. [https://www.sb.by/articles/rasplata-vysshey-meroy.html Расплата высшей мерой] // [[:ru:Советская Белоруссия|Советская Белоруссия]], 23.05.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Sergeychik was born in 1970 in He was born in Semyonovka village, [[Byerastavitsa District]], [[BSSR]] in a large family. He had a brother and a sister. Sergeychik's father was an alcoholic who often beat his wife and children, and then completely abandoned the family for another woman. Sergeychik graduated from the Makarovskaya secondary school. Later, he attended [[vocational school]] to be a driver. From 1989 to 1991, he served in the [[Armed Forces of the USSR]] before he was demobilized in November 1991. After the demobilization, he returned to his native village, where he worked as a driver for a local enterprise.

In March 1992, he saw an announcement about recruitment for the police, where he applied for a position. Sergeychik graduated with honors from the [[Ministry of the Interior Academy of the Republic of Belarus]], married, and had two children. He worked as a company commander of the Grodno District Department. In the workplace, he was described as a "responsible and executive worker". At the time of his arrest, he had the rank of senior police lieutenant.

== Crimes ==
Sergeychik committed his first crime on September 18, 1992, having stolen a trailer on the collective farm "Oktyabr", after which he began to break into garages, stealing cars and other property. He stole a carbine, a [[Walther PP]] pistol and several dummy grenades. In 14 years Sergeychik stole property worth 900 thousand dollars.

He committed his first murder in April 2000, when he picked up 21-year old Helen Boltak as a traveling companion, driving her 76 km in the [[Shchuchyn District]] forest, where he drank a bottle of alcohol prepared beforehand. They engaged in sexual intercourse, and when she lost consciousness, he strangled her, doused her with gasoline and lit her on fire after taking her jewelry and cash.

In June 2000, Sergeychik came to the apartment of his 31-year old mistress, Svetlana Pyrskaya. According to his confession, after a quarrel with her about divorcing his wife,  "in a fit of anger" and "under the influence of alcohol", he strangled her with a TV cable, then staged her suicide by hanging her in the bathroom, after which he took all the cash from the apartment that he could find.

In late July 2000 after acquainting himself with 19-year old Lyudmila Kodik, he took her out on the pretext of checking out the [[Neman]] river, where he drank alcohol with the victim, engaged in sex with her, beat her severely, strangled her with a rope prepared in advance and dropped her body into the river. After that Sergeychik robbed her, and burgled her apartment.

In 2001, Sergeychik assaulted several detainees arrested for drinking alcohol in public places.

His next murder was in September 2002. He worked with an accomplice, his 18-year old nephew Dmitry Barkov. Initially, the criminals drove a car several hours along the streets of Grodno unsuccessfully searching fora  suitable victim. They drove out of town, where they saw a [[VAZ-2106]] [[Zhiguli (car brand)|Zhiguli]] parked near the roadside. Sergeychik and Barkov, armed with Alexander's pistol, approached the car. Sergeychik knocked on the driver's door, after which he demanded that the driver, Viktor Syrytsya, hand over the keys to the car, presenting his service certificate. The driver was shot in the head through the windshield, but survived. Then Sergeychik and Barkov dragged Syrytsya out of the car and beat him to death.

The passenger was Syrenitsa Elena Turchennik. She tried to escape, but Barkov caught her, beat her and dragged her to his car. The criminals then took turns raping her, before Sergeychik strangled her with a cable. They robbed the victims, tied the corpses with a car cable and left them in the car trunk.

In November 2003, Sergeychik, while on duty, beat up a detainee in the workplace and used a gas canister against him, as a result of which he had to call for an ambulance, but the case was ignored.

In February 2005, Sergeychik, in a state of intoxication, quarreled with his wife and came to his friend's mistress Natalia Basis. Earlier his friend and Sergeychik drank alcohol at her apartment. After several hours Sergeychik returned to the apartment, where he beat up the landlady, then raped her, strangling her with her bra and leaving the corpse in the bathroom. He burgled the apartment and fled the scene.

== Arrest and trial ==
After Basis' murder, her friends were investigated, including Sergeychik. By that time he had resigned from internal affairs. He was summoned for interrogation, since his fingerprints were found on the fragments of a bottle that he had broken on Basis' head. Sergeychik tried to deny any connection to the murder, but began to get confused during the testimony and came under suspicion. After the police searched his apartment and garages, item stolen from Kodik's apartment were located, in addition to an arsenal of weapons and other stolen property. In February 2006, the former policeman was charged with two murders and robberies, for which he was imprisoned.

Soon he was charged with four more murders, based on traces of his DNA at the crime scenes. Sergeychik began to confess, admitting to the murders of eleven women and one man. In addition to the proven crimes, Sergeychik confessed to the murders of Olga Geroshchuk, Olga Shor, Elena Runets, Yulia Yatsyshina, Gulnara Azizova and Alexandra Kornat. He confessed that all of them were raped and killed, then either burned or dropped into the Neman. The bodies were never found, so the accusations of these murders were not brought against him.

Psychiatrists concluded that the serial killer was sane.

The trial of Alexander Sergeychik and Dmitry Barkov began on February 20, 2007, in a closed court. Sergeychik was accused of committing murders with "special cruelty to conceal another crime from hooligan motives", rape, theft of property, including theft of firearms, illegal carrying, storage, transportation of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naviny.by/rubrics/disaster/2007/01/26/ic_news_124_266080 Суд над бывшим милиционером, обвиняемом в 12 убийствах, начнется 20 февраля] // Naviny.by. Белорусские новости, 26.01.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2007, Sergeychik was found guilty of all charges, and sentenced to an exceptional penalty by the Grodno District court - death through execution with confiscation of all his property. Dmitry Barkov was sentenced to 10 years in a penal colony.&lt;ref&gt;Дорощёнок Т.

Белорусские новости, 22.05.2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus left the verdict unchanged.

On November 26, 2007, the verdict was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Будкевич В. [http://naviny.by/rubrics/disaster/2007/11/28/ic_articles_124_154186 Бывший милиционер-убийца Сергейчик расстрелян] // Naviny.by. Белорусские новости, 28.11.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences for the Ministry of Internal Affairs ==
Sergeychik's arrest led to a scandal in the law enforcement bodies. On October 28, 2007, President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] signed Decree No. 540 "On incomplete service compliance". For violations of the lawfulness and inaction of this case to strict disciplinary responsibility, according to the Prosecutor General of Belarus Petr Miklashevich, "a number of employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and prosecutors have been recruited from the General Prosecutor's Office to the regional district levels".

As a result, the first deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs RB Alexander Shchurko was warned.

Reprimands were given to the State Secretary of the Security Council Viktor Sheiman, Interior Minister Vladimir Naumov, his deputies Viktor Filistovich and Viktor Zhiburtovich, Deputy Prosecutor General Stepan Kosukha and Viktor Prus. Strict reprimands were given to the former head of the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Grodno oblast executive committee, and the deputy of the House of Representatives Anatoliy Beloshevsky, the former first deputy head of the Internal Affairs Director Viktor Zherebilo, the former heads of the Grodno regional administration of the Okhrana association under MVD Vladimir Pekarsky and Ivan Zmurshchik. The former First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikhail Udovikov was deprived of his firearms.

On October 31, 2007, the prosecutor of the Grodno region Vasiliy Litvinov, his deputy Vladimir Onisko and the prosecutor of the Oktyabrsky District of the city of Grodno, Boris Taranko, were relieved from their posts.&lt;ref&gt;Золотницкий А.

==Police tales involving Jesus Silva==
One time, to escape police arrest, Jesus Silva hid himself in the housing of a public telephone.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt; Jesus Silva also fired a sub-machine gun from atop the shoulders of a taller accomplice.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jesus silva"/&gt; On one occasion, during a police investigation in a morro in Salvador, several teams were attempting to capture a bandit. By radio, police officers communicated about the operation and the warning that the bandit walked off the morro. Jesus Silva had dribbled the police: When the police officers were discussing if the criminal had escaped, one of the officers said: "Only a dwarf has walked", one police officers responded: "The dwarf was the man!", but Jesus Silva had already escaped.&lt;ref name="chucky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jesus silva"/&gt;

'''Orlando Sabino Camargo''' (born September 4, 1946 in [[Arapongas]] - June 8, 2013 in [[Barbacena]]), known as the '''"Monster of Capinópolis''', was a [[Brazil]]ian suspected serial killer who allegedly murdered 12 people using revolvers and rifles, as well as beating and stabbing 19 [[calf|calves]] to death using a sickle in the regions of [[Triângulo Mineiro]] and [[Alto Paranaíba]], and in south [[Goiás]]. Aside from this, he was also accused committing numerous crimes related to theft, robbery and rape.

He was described as a short, shallow man with a frightened and introverted look, with features reminiscent of the [[autistic]] spectrum for not reacting to a shot by a nearby officer at the time of his capture.&lt;ref name=monster&gt;[http://www.portaldearaguari.com.br/2011/05/historia-do-monstro-de-capinopolis.html The story of the "Monster of Capinópolis" wins book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414082946/http://www.portaldearaguari.com.br/2011/05/historia-do-monstro-de-capinopolis.html |date=2017-04-14 }} Accessed on July 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories that point at the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|Military Dictatorship]] as responsible for this crimes, which were done on for political reasons, although these theories have never been confirmed. Sabino was considered a symbolic figure in local folklore at the time of his activities, as many people thought he was endowed with supernatural abilities because of his insight, strength and his level of dangerousness.

== Life ==
Orlando Sabino Camargo is said to have been born in Arapongas, in a furniture shop in northern [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], on September 4, 1946. Son of farmer couple Jorge Francisco and Benedita Rodrigues, he was one of the couple's seven children. He ran away from home in his early twenties after watching his boss murder his father. After traveling for miles, he arrived at the Alto Paranaíba region, where he was accused of practicing robbery in the [[Araxá]] region and murdering in [[Patrocínio]] and [[Coromandel, Minas Gerais|Coromandel]].

He then supposedly went to the south of [[Minas Gerais]], where he allegedly committed homicides in the Davinópolis and Ouvidor regions, afterwards heading to [[Tupaciguara]], [[Centralina, Minas Gerais|Centralina]], [[Capinópolis]] and [[Canápolis]]. Sabino was known for invading farms and spending long periods free of human contact, sneaking through the bushes.

He was captured in [[Ipiaçu]] on the banks of the Tejuco River in Minas Gerais, after seventeen days of persecution in the largest manhunt ever held in the state, with two hundred policemen patrolling the areas.&lt;ref name=monster/&gt;

In 1972, he was hospitalized in an asylum and diagnosed with an [[intellectual disability]], being released after completing his 38 years and 6 months sentence in the Judicial Hospital of Professor Mario Vaz. On April 1, 2011, he was admitted to an [[almshouse]] for the elderly.

== Death ==
He was found dead the morning of June 8, 2013, in a nursing home in the municipality of Barbacena, Minas Gerais, by one of the staff. A [[heart attack]] waws identified as the cause of death.

His body is buried in the Santo Antônio cemetery in Barbacena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogdoroque.com.br/2013/09/26/homem-conhecido-como-mostro-de-capinopolis-e-com-familiares-em-sao-joao-do-ivai-morre-em-minas-gerais/]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Documentary ==
Despite the great controversy surrounding Orlando Sabino - where many claim that he was a murderous monster and others claim that he only the victim of the Military Regime - the newspaper ''Todo Em Dia'' produced a documentary based on the book [https://www.tudoemdia.com/2018/05/documentario-orlando-sabino-o-monstro-de-capinopolis/ "The Monster of Capinópolis"] by journalist Pedro Popó.

'''Perry Edward Smith''' (October 27, 1928 – April 14, 1965) was one of two career criminals convicted of murdering the four members of the Clutter family in [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]], on November 15, 1959, a crime that was made famous by [[Truman Capote]] in his 1966 [[non-fiction novel]] ''[[In Cold Blood]]''.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899952,00.html Anatomy of a Murder, Time Magazine, December 22, 1967] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721101615/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C899952%2C00.html |date=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capote"&gt;Capote, Truman.

==Family and early life==
Perry Edward Smith was born in [[Huntington, Nevada|Huntington]], [[Nevada]], a now-abandoned community in [[Elko County, Nevada|Elko County]].&lt;ref name="nevada"&gt;{{cite web|first=Guy|last=Rocha|url=http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/nsla/archives/myth/myth141.htm|title=In Cold Blood: The Nevada Connection|publisher=Nevada State Library and Archives|location=Carson City, Nevada|date=September 2007|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612025504/http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/nsla/archives/myth/myth141.htm |archive-date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Florence Julia "Flo" Buckskin and John "Tex" Smith, were [[rodeo]] performers.&lt;ref name="nevada"/&gt; Sources conflict on whether Smith was of mixed Dutch and [[Shoshone]] ancestry (from his father's and mother's side, respectively)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20141217194612/http://www.rgj.com/story/life/2014/03/04/guy-rocha-in-cold-blood-and-its-connection-to-nevada/5991747/ Guy Rocha: ‘In Cold Blood’ and its connection to Nevada], Guy Rocha, [[Reno Gazette-Journal]], March 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or Irish{{ndash}}Cherokee.{{sfn|Capote|1987|p=621}} The family moved to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Alaska]] in 1929, where the elder Smith distilled [[moonshine|bootleg whisky]] for a living. Smith's father [[domestic violence|abused]] his wife and four children, and in 1935 his wife left him, taking the children with her to [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="nevada"/&gt;

Smith and his siblings were raised initially with their [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother, Flo. After Flo died from choking on her own vomit when he was 13, he and his siblings were placed in a [[Catholic]] [[orphanage]], where nuns allegedly&lt;ref name="Capote, In Cold Blood"&gt;Capote, In Cold Blood.&lt;/ref&gt; abused him [[physical abuse|physically]] and [[emotional abuse|emotionally]] for his lifelong problem of chronic [[bed wetting]], a result of malnutrition. He was also placed in a [[Salvation Army]] orphanage, where one of the caretakers allegedly&lt;ref name="Capote, In Cold Blood"/&gt; tried to drown him. In his adolescence, Smith reunited with his father, Tex, and together they lived an itinerant existence across much of the western United States. Smith also spent time in different [[juvenile detention]] homes after joining a street gang and becoming involved in petty crime. In the mid-1960s, Tex moved to [[Cold Springs, Washoe County, Nevada|Cold Springs, Nevada]], where he lived to the age of 92 before committing [[suicide]], distraught over poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D793%26Itemid%3D95 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203084541/http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=793&amp;Itemid=95 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of Smith's siblings also committed suicide as young adults, and the remaining sister eliminated any contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljworld.com/specials/incoldblood/psmith.html ''In Cold Blood: A Legacy''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115070207/http://www.ljworld.com/specials/incoldblood/psmith.html |date=January 15, 2010 }}.

==Military service and life in Washington==
At age 16, Smith joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]]. He joined the [[United States Army]] in 1948, where he served in the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name="courts"&gt;Keglovits, Sally J. [https://www.webcitation.org/5VJP4tNh9?url=http://www.uscourts.gov/fedprob/June_2004/incoldblood.html ''In Cold Blood Revisited: A Look Back at an American Crime'']. US Courts.gov. June 2004. Accessed: 2008-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stint in the Army, Smith spent weeks at a time in the [[stockade]] for public carousing and fighting with Korean civilians and other soldiers. In spite of his record, Smith received an [[honorable discharge]] in 1952 and was last stationed at [[Fort Lewis]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt;

Smith stayed with an Army friend for a time in the [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] area, where he was employed as a car painter. With one of his first paychecks, Smith bought a motorcycle. While riding, he lost control of the bike due to adverse weather conditions. Smith nearly died in the accident and spent six months in a [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] hospital. Because of the severe injuries, his legs were permanently disabled&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt; and he suffered chronic leg pains for the rest of his life. To help control the pain, Smith consumed an excessive amount of aspirin.&lt;ref name="Capote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="courts"/&gt;

== The murders and life on death row ==

{{See also|Clutter family murders}}

Perry Smith and [[Richard Hickock]] first met in the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]] in [[Lansing, Kansas|Lansing]], [[Kansas]]. Smith was eventually [[parole]]d, and the pair later resumed their acquaintance upon Hickock's release in November 1959. Hickock allegedly wrote to Smith, imploring him to violate his parole by returning to Kansas to assist Hickock with a [[robbery]] he had been planning. Smith claimed that his return was initially motivated not by meeting with Hickock, but by the chance to reunite with another former inmate, Willie-Jay, with whom he had developed an especially close bond while in prison; Smith soon discovered, however, that he had arrived in the [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] area just a few hours after Willie-Jay had left for the east coast.

Smith met with Hickock, and almost immediately the two set to work carrying out Hickock's plan. Driving west to [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], they entered the Clutter home through an unlocked door late in the evening of November 14, 1959, whereupon they murdered the four family members present: Herbert Clutter and his wife Bonnie, and their younger children, Nancy and Kenyon. Hickock later testified that he had gotten the idea to rob the Clutters after being told by former cellmate Floyd Wells, who had worked as a farmhand for the Clutters, that there was a safe in the family's house containing $10,000. When they [[home invasion|invaded]] the house, however, they discovered that there was no such safe.&lt;ref name="Capote"/&gt; After six weeks at large, mostly spent idly roaming the country, Smith and Hickock were captured in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], on December 30, 1959, following an extensive manhunt which extended into [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="nevada"/&gt;

Smith admitted to cutting the throat of the father, Herbert Clutter, as well as shooting both Herbert and Kenyon Clutter in the head with a shotgun at close range. Records show a dispute as to which of the two shot the women, Bonnie and Nancy Clutter. Alvin Dewey, chief investigator of the Clutter family murders, testified at the trial that Hickock insisted in his confession that Smith performed all four killings; Smith, however, first confessed that Hickock killed the women, but refused to sign his confession, and later claimed to have shot them himself. Although Smith's revised confession coincided with Hickock's initial statement, both Smith and Hickock refused to testify in court, leading to a lack of an official record detailing who killed the women.

While Smith had only a grade-school education, he maintained a strong interest in art, literature and music. His rough past regarding his family and abusive childhood led him to be somewhat distant from people. He read extensively, and during his time on [[death row]], wrote poems and painted pictures for other inmates from photos of their family members.&lt;ref&gt;Bruntz, Michael. [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/apr/05/witness_to_execution/ ''Witness to execution''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419233629/http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/apr/05/witness_to_execution/ |date=April 20, 2015 }}. Lawrence Journal-World. 5 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Truman Capote===
During research for his novel ''[[In Cold Blood (book)|In Cold Blood]]'', [[Truman Capote]] extensively interviewed Smith and eventually befriended him.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Suzanna. [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/apr/06/death_penalty_kansans/ ''Death penalty: Kansans continue to debate capital punishment decades later''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923202735/http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/apr/06/death_penalty_kansans/ |date=September 23, 2016 }}. Lawrence Journal-World. 6 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
Smith and Hickock were executed by [[hanging]] on April 14, 1965. Smith was hanged second, dying at 1:19 am.&lt;ref name="Capote"/&gt;

==Exhumation==
Nearly 50 years after the executions, the bodies of the killers were exhumed from Mount Muncie Cemetery in Lansing, as authorities hoped to solve a 53-year-old [[cold case]] using [[DNA]]. Smith and Hickock had originally been questioned about the December 19, 1959, shooting murder in [[Osprey, Florida|Osprey]], [[Florida]] of [[Walker family murders|Cliff and Christine Walker and their two young children]], as evidence indicated they had spent time just a few miles from the crime scene while at large after the Clutter murders. A [[polygraph]] administered at the time of their arrest cleared them of the murders, but by modern polygraph standards, their test results are no longer considered valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Olson|first=Cora|title='In Cold Blood' Killers Suspected in Cold Case of Florida Family Massacre|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/blog/2012/12/04/in-cold-blood-killers-suspected-in-cold-case-of-a-florida-family-massacre/index.html?link=obnetwork|work=Crime Library|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 2012, officials in Kansas exhumed the bodies of Smith and Hickock and retrieved bone fragments to compare their DNA to [[semen]] found in the pants of Christine Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='In Cold Blood' Killers Exhumed, Investigators Hope to Solve 53-Year-Old Cold Case|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/cold-blood-killers-exhumed-investigators-hope-solve-53/story?id=18007706#.UNEjc-RQWe0|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='In Cold Blood' killers' bodies exhumed in second murder investigation|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/19/16019409-in-cold-blood-killers-bodies-exhumed-in-second-murder-investigation?lite|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=NBC News|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanderson|first=Bill|title='In Cold Blood' killers' bodies exhumed to check for link in 1959 Florida slaying|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/in_cold_blood_echo_687gdcvxGZMSTIzKuLtRAK|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=New York Post|date=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, the [[Sarasota County]] Sheriff's office announced they were unable to find a match between the DNA of Smith or Hickock and the samples in the Walker family murder. Only partial DNA could be retrieved, possibly due to degradation of the DNA samples over the decades or contamination in storage, making the outcome one of uncertainty (neither proving nor disproving the involvement of Smith and Hickock). Investigators have stated that Smith and Hickock still remain the most viable suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Koehn|first=Donna|title=No DNA link between Walker murders, 'In Cold Blood' killers|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20130813/ARTICLE/130819868|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=Herald Tribune|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film portrayals==
Smith was portrayed in the 1967 film version of ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'' by [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], by [[Eric Roberts]] in the [[In Cold Blood (miniseries)|1996 TV miniseries adaptation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0116619|title=In Cold Blood - TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] in 2005's ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0379725|title=Capote}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Daniel Craig]] in 2006's ''[[Infamous (film)|Infamous]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0420609|title=Infamous}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song==
[[Bastille (band)|Bastille]]'s 2016 album ''[[Wild World (album)|Wild World]]'' includes a song entitled "Four Walls (The Ballad of Perry Smith)". The lyrics describe the imprisonment and execution of Smith. "These four walls in Holcomb" tells of how Smith has "only these four walls before they, in cold blood, hang you up", and directly quotes a call from Kansas State Penitentiary where Smith says, "Being brought up one way and trying to see another way is very difficult."

'''Albert Schmidt''' (born in [[Potsdam]], [[Prussia]] – died November 18, 1890 in [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Australia]]; year of birth unknown), also known as '''The Wagga Murderer''', was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Australia]]n [[serial killer]] who murdered at least three men he travelled with during the late 19th-century. Convicted of killing John Young Taylor in [[Junee]] in 1890, Schmidt was subsequently hanged for this murder, without being charged with the others.&lt;ref name=exe&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/208395646?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Execution of Albert Schmidt.|publisher=The Express and Telegraph|date=November 19, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrival in Australia==
Little is known about Schmidt's early life, including his year of birth. He was a native of Potsdam, and first arrived in Australia's [[Queensland]],&lt;ref name=conf&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/102825023?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Confession of the Wagga Murderer|publisher=[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post]]|date=May 3, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/65350322?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Murder near Wagga.|publisher=[[The Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal]]|date=November 24, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; in either 1881 or 1882. He passed through [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and then surfaced in [[Peak Hill, New South Wales|Peak Hill]] and Parkes.&lt;ref name=na/&gt; He first met with John Taylor in Peak Hill, and remained his acquaintance until his eventual murder.

==Murders==
===Murrumbidgee River victim===
On October 19, 1888, a Mr. R. Whittaker was fishing in the [[Murrumbidgee River]], when he chanced upon the headless, naked body of a man stuffed into a log. He quickly contacted authorities, and they quickly began investigating the mysterious death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/128765264?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Gundagai Police Report|publisher=The Gundagai Times and Tumut, Adelong and Murrumbidgee District Advertiser|date=October 18, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man was young, rather short (1.62 meters tall) and had several pieces of flesh hanging from his body, suggesting he had put up a fierce struggle with his killer.&lt;ref name=murrum&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/47044718?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Murder at Murrumbidgee|publisher=[[South Australian Register]]|date=October 20, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was decapitated post-mortem with two distinct cuts,&lt;ref name=murrum/&gt; but neither the head, nor the clothes could be located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/108116260?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=A Headless Body.|publisher=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|date=October 20, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several inquiries by Constable Nixon, nobody reported a missing person from the surrounding area, suggesting that the deceased might've been a foreigner, possibly a labourer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/228416029?searchTerm=headless%20body&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|title=Supposed Murder near Gundagai|publisher=[[The Australian Star]]|date=October 22, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, when Schmidt was arrested for Taylor's murder, it was discovered that during the supposed time frame of the murder, he had been employed near Murrumbidgee as a fisherman. Additionally, William Givney, owner of the ''Coach and Horses'' hotel, recognized Schmidt as a man who had checked into his hotel shortly before the murder had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/101894490|title=The Late Wagga Murder|publisher=[[The Daily Advertiser (Wagga Wagga)|The Wagga Wagga Advertiser]]|date=May 15, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacob Rick===
A 54-year-old native of [[Hochkirch]], [[Prussia]], Rick had been in Australia since 1870. He was described as short, stout, of ruddy complexion, with a high forehead, black curly hair, a deformity on the left side of his [[crown (anatomy)|crown]] and with a full black beard. A resident of [[Rushworth, Victoria]], he initially had a successful job as a miner before turning towards [[prospecting]]. As he was a very steady and industrious man, which presumably made him lots of money, he got himself acquainted with John Young Taylor, Schmidt's future victim.&lt;ref name=sup&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8607304?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Supposed Murder of Jacob Rick|publisher=The Argus|date=May 21, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men travelled to [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]] on October 23, 1889, where he withdrew 30 dollars. As Taylor had paid for both's expenses, it is assumed that Rick was in a dire financial situation. Disappointed by the false advertisement of the situation in the area, the duo moved to Lambing Flats, where they met with Albert Schmidt. After prospecting for some time, Taylor left for Rushworth in December, leaving Rick and Schmidt in Lambing Flats.&lt;ref name=sup/&gt; He took some of Jacob's items and brought them to his friends, telling them that he would come back soon and would definitely write to them.&lt;ref name=con&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197018341?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Country News: Rushworth|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=April 18, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick was last seen alive on [[New Year's Eve]] in [[Wee Jasper, New South Wales|Wee Jasper]], accompanied by Schmidt, on a horse-drawn carriage.&lt;ref name=arg&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8606788?searchTerm=Jacob%20Rick&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Smidt, The Wagga Murderer|publisher=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]|date=May 17, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Schmidt returned to Wee Jasper on January 3, he was asked by various people about Rick's whereabouts. Albert (who presented himself as "Alfred Smitz", from [[Hamburg]]), gave various explanations,&lt;ref name=arg/&gt; including that he was in a [[gold rush]].&lt;ref name=con/&gt; In the meantime, he disposed of the carriage and the horse. When Taylor returned, Schmidt reunited with and followed John everywhere, eagerly convincing him to leave Rushworth for [[Tumbarumba]], where he claimed they could find lots of gold. He was so anxious about it, that he even helped a local firm repair Taylor's wagon for 10 days, and when questioned about Rick, he claimed that he had been left behind in [[Albury]]. The duo then promptly left the area.&lt;ref name=sup/&gt;

When the news about Taylor's murder spread, suspicion fell on Schmidt concerning Rick's disappearance. Mounted police and [[aboriginal tracker]]s were dispatched towards Wee Jasper in search of Rick's body, which was believed to have been buried somewhere in the outback.&lt;ref name=arg/&gt; Although the body was never located, Schmidt was connected to his murder through Jacob's silver watch, which was found to be in his former companion's possession.&lt;ref name=mel&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/159546568?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Murder Near Wagga: Melbourne section|publisher=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Adelaide Observer]]|date=May 3, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being questioned by Rev. John McIntyre in order to confess to the killing, Schmidt wasn't persuaded to do so, but suspiciously remarked that "it was enough to die for one man."&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;&lt;ref name=arg/&gt;

===John Young Taylor===
On April 7, 1890, Schmidt and Taylor were both seen together at Junee, mucking about. In the following hours, multiple witnesses observed Taylor become increasingly intoxicated with brandy in several establishments, with his friend Schmidt only having small pints of [[shandygaff]]. Eventually, they were last seen in a hotel in [[Alfredtown]], and after they left, they in the direction of a mutual friend named King. On the way in the wagon, the drunken Taylor mocked Albert and called him a liar, whom initially refused to retaliate. In the heat of the moment, Schmidt grabbed a tomahawk and hit John on the head, causing him to fall out of the wagon.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt; Quickly realising that he had died, Schmidt panicked, wondering where he would hide the body out in the open. After deliberating for some time, he eventually bought a shovel from a store near Old Junee and decided to bury him near a railroad. He noticed some men working nearby, so he camped until nighttime, when he stripped the bloodied clothes off the corpse and cut the throat. At some point, he heard a crack, which came from the neck. In order not to have Taylor's body identified, he decapitated him, burying the body and head in different locations before burning the clothes and washing the wagon off in a nearby spring.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt;

After concealing his crime, Schmidt decided to go to Wagga Wagga, where he would confess his sins before a clergyman and then end his life. Before that, he would write down a confession in his notebook about the killing. While travelling along the Junee road, he came across two policemen, who noticed blood dripping off the wagon. Frozen in fear, Schmidt was arrested and put on the wagon so he could be driven back to the police station. On the way, he unsuccessfully tried to cut his throat with a razor and then a penknife, but was prevented; a bit later on, when he came to his senses, he grabbed his revolver and tried to fire it, initially unsuccessfully, and afterwards firing a non-lethal shot into his mouth. He was then sent off to the hospital, where he directed the authorities to the body's location. After his recovery, he was sent to the prison lock-up, where he was later visited by Rev. John McIntyre for an interview, in which he broke down and wept on several occasions.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt;

==Trial, sentence and execution==
More than a month after his arrest, Schmidt's trial began. Multiple witnesses were called and plenty of evidence was produced, with Schmidt himself giving a written statement of the crime, which was read out to the court judge by Inspector Harrison. The jury gave a verdict of wilful murder, and Schmidt's trial before the [[assizes]] was scheduled for September 26.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/138848821?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=The Wagga Tragedy|publisher=[[The Newcastle Herald|The Newcastle Morning Herald]]|date=April 30, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded not guilty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227465324?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=WAGGA WAGGA MURDER.|publisher=[[The Australian Star]]|date=September 26, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was again found guilty and [[sentenced to death]], to which he expressed no discernible emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227475957?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Wagga Wagga Murder|publisher=The Australian Star|date=September 30, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the gallows where prepared for Schmidt, he appeared shattered, yet accepting of, his eventual faith.&lt;ref name=fai&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227470586?searchTerm=Albert%20Schmidt&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189|title=Preparations for the Execution.|publisher=The Australian Star|date=November 15, 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the date of his execution, the pale Albert ate a couple of eggs and had a cup of tea, shook the hands of all the attending workers and then stepped upon the scaffold, where Archdeacon Pownall read his prayers.&lt;ref name=exe/&gt; Choosing not to make a statement about his crimes, Schmidt shook hands with the minister before the executioner, Robert Howard,&lt;ref name=fai/&gt; the bolt was drawn and he was let down, dying almost instantaneously. After the body was left hanging for about half an hour, it was put in a coffin and buried in the prison cemetery.&lt;ref name=exe/&gt;
